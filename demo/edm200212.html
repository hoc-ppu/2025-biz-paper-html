			<p>This House deplores the Government's ongoing use of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries against the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review; notes that while the publication of the Review has been much delayed without explanation, it is expected to recommend the cessation of all deportations of people who have lived in the UK since childhood; notes that the Government has sought to justify recent deportations on the basis of the serious nature of the offences perpetrated by deportees, where this is not borne out in many cases; believes that where deportations are enforced on Foreign National Offenders who have served their sentences, this amounts to double punishment on arbitrary grounds; further believes that long-term residents should be rehabilitated in an equal fashion to their British-passport-holding peers; fears that the characterisation of all deportees as serious criminals exacerbates anti-migrant sentiment, increases racial tensions and exposes those deported to greater risk upon return; remains concerned that the Government's approach demonstrates a failure to appreciate the significant damage to trust in immigration enforcement that the Windrush Scandal represented; and calls on the Government to immediately suspend all deportations of residents who have been in the UK since childhood, and to publish and implement in full recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the overturning by the High Court of Justice Tolson’s ruling in the Central Family Court that a sexual assault did not constitute rape because the woman had taken no physical step to encourage the man to desist; notes with concern the High Court’s findings that Justice Tolson failed to apply the definitions of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour, dismissed or ignored reports from the police, failed to allow the Appellant to make her full submission and repeatedly interrupted her; further notes with concern the High Court’s findings on Justice Tolson’s judgment that the real risk of the appearance of a partisan approach in that judge’s conduct was self-evident and that the fact that the judge preferred the Respondent’s case was patent throughout his judgment; highlights the High Court’s further findings that Justice Tolson’s reasons for dismissing the evidence of the Appellant were wrong, specifically, that he made a finding regarding the Appellant’s psychological state of mind without any forensic expert evidence; further highlights that the High Court found that Justice Tolson’s approach towards the issue of consent was manifestly at odds with current jurisprudence, concomitant sexual behaviour, and what is currently acceptable socio-sexual conduct; notes with concern that Justice Tolson continues to preside over cases involving domestic abuse and rape in the Family Courts; and calls on the Government to take steps with the Judicial College to ensure that training is made mandatory for family court and criminal court judges on the legally correct and appropriate approach to take when hearing domestic abuse and sexual assault allegations.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the poor mental health, including feelings of depression and anxiety, experienced by nearly half of people after a bereavement as revealed in Sue Ryder’s recent survey; notes that this is partly a result of a lack of conversation in society around grief with a third of bereaved people feeling unable to talk openly about their loss; recognises the reluctance of people to start a conversation with someone who is bereaved with over half being scared they would say the wrong thing and nearly half not knowing what to say; commends Sue Ryder for launching the #JustSaySomething campaign; encourages people who have been bereaved to open up to their support network and ask for help from their GP if they need it, those supporting someone struggling with their grief to encourage conversation and be ready to listen and for people supporting those who are grieving to find tips on how to do this on the Sue Ryder website; and further recognises the role of public figures in society in facilitating and encouraging everyone dealing with bereavement to talk freely when they want to and to create as compassionate a society as possible.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the slow implementation of many areas of the Peace Accord in Colombia, including rural reform, crop substitution and victims’ rights to justice which lie at the root of the conflict, as well as the often disproportionate use of force by officials in response to social protest; notes with alarm that areas vacated by the FARC have been filled by other illegal armed groups and militarised more generally, resulting in local populations being marginalised and threatened; urges the Colombian Government to comply with Resolution 1190/2018 of the Ministry of the Interior when addressing social protest, to seriously consider making the National Police accountable to civilian authorities rather than the Ministry of Defence, to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of on-going attacks and killings of social leaders and human rights defenders, and to implement all elements of the Peace Accord, as well as territorial development plans (PDETs); and calls on the Government to closely monitor spending by the Colombian Government of the UK’s funding for the implementation of the Peace Accord, to continue playing a key role on the UN Security Council on Colombia, including with the Verification Mission, whose mandate should be renewed for a further three years, and to continue supporting the Colombian Government and civil society in fully implementing the Peace Accord to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>
