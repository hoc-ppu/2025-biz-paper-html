			<p class="MotionSponsor">Fiona Bruce</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House commends the extraordinary care that families and carers provide for SEND children and young people; recognises that the need to provide full time care during the covid-19 crisis has put families under chronic additional strain and pressure; notes that 50 per cent of families with disabled children are living in poverty and that Carer’s Allowance, at £67.50 per week, is insultingly low; believes that families and carers responsible for children and young people with SEND need increased support; therefore calls for SEND schools and centres to be given bespoke covid-19 guidance that meets the particular needs and behaviours of SEND children and young people, and acknowledges the specific adaptations and timescales required for a safe return to the schools and centres they attended before lockdown; and further calls on the Government to increase funding for good quality respite care centres and respite carers to alleviate the pressure on families, to recognise the extraordinary care that people provide in their own homes by paying carers a real living wage and giving them paid annual leave, and to bring forward a strategy to recruit more respite carers that recognises and pays them as professionals with specialist skills.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Midlothian based Skyrora Ltd on completing the UK’s first ground rocket test in Scotland in 50 years; commends its work in making the UK ready for launching rockets into space after its team successfully built a mobile launch complex and completed a full static fire test with the Skylark-L rocket on it in only five days; recognises that Skyrora's achievements signify the first vertical static fire test of this magnitude in the UK since the Black Arrow Programme, 50 years ago; notes that the Skylark L rocket could be ready to launch from a British spaceport by spring 2021 and the inaugural launch of the low Earth orbital (LEO) Skyrora XL rocket by 2023; further notes that the company plan to use its Ecosene, an equivalent Kerosene fuel made from un-recyclable plastic waste; recognises the mammoth efforts and expert handling of everyone involved in the operation which was carried out whilst having to adhere to very strict social distancing measures, and in the remote location of the Scottish highlands; credits Skyrora in its aim to cater for the growing demand to send commercial satellites into space using a combination of proven technology, advanced manufacturing and detailed knowledge; applauds this historic milestone that is the start of the UK’s new space revolution, a fantastic example of the potential that the UK Space industry holds for future; and wishes Skyrora every success as it is poised to make the UK a serious leader in the space business once again.</p>

			<p>That this House regrets that the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill 2019-2021 will end free movement of people without giving Parliament an opportunity to debate future immigration policy; urges the Government to lay a report before both Houses of Parliament that outlines its position on immigration policy in light of the covid-19 pandemic; further urges the Government to consider as part of that report the granting of free and automatic UK citizenship to all workers in the health and social care sector that have made or seek to make applications.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that many workers earning the minimum wage are currently only receiving 80 per cent of their minimum wage salary under the Government’s furlough scheme; is concerned that workers are being expected to live on less than the state-declared minimum wage especially given that rents, bills and food prices have not fallen; is concerned that in the House on 12 May 2020, following a question calling for the introduction of a minimum wage floor to the furlough scheme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer responding by suggesting that workers could seek additional employment which for many is not possible during the covid-19 crisis; notes that women and Black, Asian and minority ethnic workers are more likely to be in lower-paid work; calls on the Government to put in place guarantees to ensure that no furloughed worker is forced to live on less than 100 per cent of the national minimum wage.</p>
