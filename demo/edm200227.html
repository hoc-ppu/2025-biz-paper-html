			<p>That this House acknowledges that the Department for Work and Pensions commissioned an evidence review on the drivers of food bank use in 2018; notes the Government's commitment to this House to publish the findings of the review; further notes the Government's failure to date to publish those findings; and urges the Government to provide a clear deadline as a matter of urgency for the publication of the review to inform a public debate on the reasons for growing demand for food aid provision in the UK.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Stephen Doughty</span><span class="signatory">Claire Hanna</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the May 2019 recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change that the cheapest renewables, onshore wind and solar, should have a Government backed route to market; recognises that the deployment of renewables needs to be accelerated through the 2020s in order to deliver net-zero emissions; notes that onshore wind and solar have been excluded from the Government’s Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions since the first round in 2014; and calls on the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to ensure that future auction rounds are open to both technologies.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Stephen Doughty</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the commitment by the Government to increase maximum sentences for animal cruelty from six months to five years; notes that the current maximum sentences in England and Wales are the lowest in Europe, are significantly lower than in Northern Ireland where perpetrators can be sentenced to between two and five years in prison, and are lower than for the crime of fly-tipping which can receive a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment; welcomes the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Private Members Bill tabled by the hon. Member for West Dorset; further welcomes the Government’s indication that it intends to adequately reflect the violent nature of animal cruelty crimes by backing this Bill; calls on the Government to also urgently amend the Animal Welfare Act 2006 so that extended maximum sentences for animal cruelty do not only apply to owners and keepers and can instead also be used in cases such as that of the Brighton cat killer.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the urgent reversal of the decision to make over-75s pay for TV licences; notes with concern that over 240,000 households in Scotland could be hit by the decision; further notes that 73 per cent of households in Scotland with someone aged over 75 could have their TV licence taken away and that over three million households across the UK are at risk of being affected; is concerned that many over-75s who are eligible for Pension Credit, but not currently claiming it, will be liable to pay the £154.50 TV licence fee; believes that responsibility for funding free TV licences should never have been handed over by the UK Government to the BBC; strongly believes that licence fees should be set independently of the Government to prevent the Government from short-changing pensioners in the future; and calls on the Government to fully fund licences for over-75s.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern that according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation UK Poverty Report 2019-20 the proportion of people in work who live in poverty went up for the third consecutive year to a record high; further notes that according to the report 7 in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family; is alarmed that after a decade of austerity too many people remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and invariably are failed by the social security system; believes that the UK needs a society with higher living standards for everyone and that no-one should lack the means to survive or have to choose between life's essentials; and therefore calls on the Government to eliminate in-work poverty by ending austerity, raising living standards and empowerment in the workplace, strengthening and expanding public services free at the point of use paid for fairly through taxation, and making sure that the social security system looks after people in their time of need.</p>

			<p>This House deplores the Government's ongoing use of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries against the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review; notes that while the publication of the Review has been much delayed without explanation, it is expected to recommend the cessation of all deportations of people who have lived in the UK since childhood; notes that the Government has sought to justify recent deportations on the basis of the serious nature of the offences perpetrated by deportees, where this is not borne out in many cases; believes that where deportations are enforced on Foreign National Offenders who have served their sentences, this amounts to double punishment on arbitrary grounds; further believes that long-term residents should be rehabilitated in an equal fashion to their British-passport-holding peers; fears that the characterisation of all deportees as serious criminals exacerbates anti-migrant sentiment, increases racial tensions and exposes those deported to greater risk upon return; remains concerned that the Government's approach demonstrates a failure to appreciate the significant damage to trust in immigration enforcement that the Windrush Scandal represented; and calls on the Government to immediately suspend all deportations of residents who have been in the UK since childhood, and to publish and implement in full recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p>This House notes with concern proposed changes to overdraft fees for individuals and businesses due to be implemented in April 2020; further notes that this would lead to substantial increases in fees for both arranged and unarranged overdrafts; recognises the need to simplify overdraft fees and however notes with concern how financial providers have used directives by the Financial Conduct Authority to maximise profits; and calls on the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority to urgently review the new pricing structure of overdrafts by UK banks and intervene to ensure fairness for consumers and businesses before the new financial year.</p>

			<p>That this House is very concerned that 2.2 billion people around the world still don’t have a reliable source of clean water; believes that far too little is being done to help the most vulnerable people adapt to climate change; notes that access to a reliable source of clean water which can withstand the impacts of climate change can mean the difference between life and death, and that this makes access to basic water and sanitation services a first line of defence against climate change; recognises that failure to adapt now will cost significantly more in the long run and threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of people; and calls for the Government to recognise and prioritise water services in climate change plans at COP26.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the international campaign Sack the Sachet by A Plastic Planet, which seeks to end the world’s reliance on single-use sachets that are so damaging to the environment; notes that globally 855 billion sachets are thrown away every year, enough to wrap the entire surface of the planet or, if placed end to end, stretch to the moon 189 times; further notes that the figure could reach one trillion by 2030; acknowledges that those sachets are almost exclusively made of plastic and are single-use items that will end up in landfill, in incinerators or directly in our natural environments; highlights that those sachets are used for a range of purposes such as condiments, toiletries and washing powder, despite all of those items having reusable and more environmentally friendly alternatives; and calls on the Government as well as hon. Members to work together to end the scourge of the plastic sachet and help build a more sustainable planet.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the new draft media law in Somalia that would restrict the right to freedom of expression; notes that the Federal Parliament of Somalia sought to amend media legislation to grant the Federal Ministry of Information extensive powers to interfere in the work of journalists and independent media houses, and impact on public interest reporting in country; further notes that the law has a number of unacceptably broad restrictions on the content of what may be published or broadcast, including a prohibition on false news, encouragement of tribalism, baseless propaganda and violating sound Somali culture; believes that the draft law would also establish a costly and unnecessary new system of prosecutors to bring and hear cases regarding media crimes; is concerned that the draft law includes legal sanctions for a long new list of media crimes which are vague and breaches a journalist’s right to confidential sources; agrees with the National Union of Journalists and the National Union of Somali journalists that the draft law could enable the Somali authorities at both Federal and State level to arbitrarily prosecute journalists to undercut free expression and access to information; and calls on the Government to press President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed to think again about the draft legislation and to decline to sign the media law and to ensure that any proposed amendments are in line with Somalia’s constitutional and international obligations and commitments to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the rise in verbal and physical abuse of shopworkers; notes that according to research conducted by USDAW, over 400 retail workers were assaulted each day last year and that 62 per cent of retail staff have been the victim of either verbal or physical abuse; further notes that the view of respected criminologists is that levels of violence against shopworkers have reached epidemic proportions with lasting effects on the lives of workers, both mentally and physically; supports demands for action called for by the Freedom of Fear campaign led by USDAW, the similar demand for action call by the Co-op Group, the GMB and other Trade Unions, other leading retailers, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience  Stores; and calls on the Government to introduce measures to tackle these issues including bringing forward legislative proposals to make assaulting a public facing worker a standalone offence which would provide not only a clear deterrent to those thinking of assaulting shopworkers but also clear routes to prosecution for the police and courts dealing with this growing problem.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the publication of the UN’s database of companies operating in Israeli settlements; acknowledges that all Israeli settlements are illegal and that the transfer of a civilian population to an occupied territory is a war crime under international law; notes that complicity in war crimes is a serious criminal offence; reaffirms the Government’s obligation to uphold international law, and the corporate responsibility of companies to respect human rights, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles; is alarmed that UK businesses are listed in the UN database, while also recognising that the database itself is not exhaustive of all companies supporting illegal settlement infrastructure; welcomes the report of Amnesty International highlighting that companies cannot do business in or with settlements without contributing to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; and calls on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and under customary international humanitarian law, by banning UK trade with illegal settlements and making binding regulations for companies to uphold human rights standards.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that workers in Higher Education (HE) have suffered a 17 per cent pay cut since 2009, a 15.1 per cent gender pay gap and a 26 per cent black and minority ethnic pay gap; further notes that in some Higher Education Institutions, 40 percent of staff are employed on temporary or casual contracts; notes that, according to surveys, university staff work an average of 51 hours per week and that there is an ongoing epidemic of poor mental health in that sector; believes that staff working conditions affect student learning and that this is damaging to both students’ education and the quality and reputation of UK HE and has an effect of the marketisation of HE funding and provision; supports the 14 day industrial action called by the University and College’s Union (UCU) for fairer pay, gender and BAME equality, more realistic workloads, more equitable pension contributions and an end to casualisation; calls on the employers to take action to address the legitimate concerns of university staff and the ongoing crisis in HE; and further calls on the Government to work with the employers and UCU to resolve that dispute and end the marketisation of the sector.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights that it is unacceptable that in 2020 women and girls pay more than men for basic products, including toiletries, clothes, and haircuts; notes that products marketed at women are, in some cases, 34 per cent more expensive than those aimed at men; further notes that the unfair price gap will have a significant financial effect on a woman over the course of her life; regrets that women are subject to the additional injustice of the gender pay gap, which sees 8 out of 10 companies still paying more to their male employees; commends companies that have adjusted their pricing and decreased the price of some of their razors so that they are more aligned with the price of men’s razors and encourages other companies to follow suit; notes the Government’s failure to support the Gender-based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill 2017-19; and calls on the Government to end the discriminatory Pink Tax by supporting the forthcoming Private Members’ Bill to be tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West.</p>
