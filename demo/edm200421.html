			<p>That this House recognises the proficient readiness of businesses and charities to adapt to this crisis through repurposing and collaboration in order to deliver essential supplies to the most vulnerable in society; notes that the Royal Bank of Scotland at its headquarters in Gogarburn has been temporarily repurposed and its workforce redeployed as volunteers to become a food distribution centre to help charities deliver support in communities; congratulates the resolve of Social Bite and the Trussell Trust to continue to fulfil and expand on their efforts to alleviate food poverty in a time of crisis by providing food and hygiene products to the vulnerable, those on low-income and in receipt of free school meals, and to those recently made redundant; acknowledges that foodbanks and a means of distribution are a lifeline for people during this crisis; and is therefore grateful for their combined action to swiftly respond to the nation’s needs.</p>

			<p>That this House celebrates the 100th birthday of Largs resident and war veteran Jack Ransom, on 15th April, the celebrations for which had to be cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak; is aware that Jack’s life began in London before he moved to Scotland, a country for which he has developed a deep affection; pays tribute to Jack’s years of military service which began in the Territorial Army, and his capture in 1942 as he was held as a prisoner of war on the infamous Thai-Burma Railway, also known as the Burmese Railway of Death where he survived the harshest of conditions; recognises that the determination and resolve Jack and his fellow prisoners displayed during their internment is an inspiration for all, especially during the current crisis; further acknowledges that during his life Jack has continued to face trials such as being widowed twice which he has borne with admirable fortitude; is mindful of the courage Jack demonstrated when he returned to the place of his wartime suffering after 65 years and has recounted his inspirational story in his memoirs The Scottish Cockney, published in 2014; shares the disappointment that Jack’s special birthday plans had to be cancelled, with over 80 of Jack’s family and friends, who had planned to attend the celebrations to mark this special occasion; and understands this will be a difficult time for the usually outgoing and energetic Jack, but is hopeful the celebrations can be rearranged when it is safe to do so.</p>

			<p>This House expresses its concern that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has advised insurers that they see no reason to intervene in cases where business interruption claims resulting from the covid-19 virus are not covered; notes that the fine print of many business interruption policies do not include provision for pandemics; further notes the reputational damage likely to be suffered by the insurance sector if payments are withheld; notes that many leading insurers have nevertheless cancelled their dividends; and calls on the Government to instruct all insurers to apply such dividends towards the settlement of insurance claims resulting from the covid-19 virus, and to negotiate with regulators and insurers as to how the balance will be paid to policyholders.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern about the extended cut-off date for employees to receive support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, after the eligibility date was extended from 28 February to 19 March; acknowledges that although this extension will allow more employees to now be furloughed following the changes to the Government scheme a large number of workers will still miss out because they are paid towards the end of each month; further notes that all workers who can be furloughed will need to have been on the payroll and the employer would need to have sent to HM Revenue &amp; Customs a real-time information submission notifying a payment in respect of those employees on or before 19 March 2020; believes that this move will not cover people who were not put on the Pay As You Earn system until after the pay cut-off date; and calls on the Government to consider further extending the cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to include this large proportion of workers who are paid monthly and the opportunity for more new employees to be furloughed.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that, for those workers covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it is providing an essential safety net for many workers and their families during this crisis, ensuring businesses can maintain their workforce and enabling them to re-open in the future; notes that the Resolution Foundation estimates that 8 million workers could be furloughed under that scheme; further notes that that whilst Government is funding 80 per cent of the payroll for furloughed staff, employers are not obliged under terms of the scheme to top up the remaining 20 per cent to ensure no loss of pay; remains concerned about the financial impact on workers of receiving only 80 per cent of their usual take home pay, an impact which is particularly difficult for those on low pay; and therefore urges highly profitable corporations like McDonald’s, KFC, and JD Wetherspoons that have made millions  from the labour of those same workers to step up and pay the remaining 20 per cent to ensure that their workers are not forced into debt and further poverty as a result of this significant cut in pay.</p>

			<p>That this House honours and recognises the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make; notes the particular sacrifices that the partners of veterans make and the consequences for them of tragically losing a spouse or partner serving in the armed forces; notes the changes announced in 2014 which allowed war widows or widowers that lost their spouse or cohabiting partner in service in the armed forces before 6 April 2005, and had not remarried by 1 April 2015, to retain their war widow pension for life regardless of ongoing relationship status; notes however that this regrettably excluded war widows bereaved before 6 April 2005 that had already had to surrender their war widows pension upon remarrying or cohabiting; believes that this is unacceptable; notes that the only way this group of war widows could regain their pensions is by divorcing their current partners and remarrying them; agrees with the then Defence Secretary who said on 18 February 2019 that this was a burning injustice, Official Report, column 1187; and therefore supports the campaign of the War Widows Association to rectify this anomaly; and urges the Government to correct this injustice by providing equalisation and compensation for the small number of war widows unjustly affected.</p>

			<p>This House expresses concern at reports that some retailers are inflating the prices of products in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak; notes that the Competition and Markets Authority has urged businesses to behave responsibly and not increase prices in response to the covid-19 crisis; applauds the actions of retailers who have not inflated prices and those that have proactively taken measures to support their customers and local community at this difficult time; believes that while many businesses are striving to do the right thing under very challenging circumstances, the continued behaviour of those seeking to capitalise on the current situation by charging unjustifiably high prices for essential goods is immoral and unjust; and urges the Government to take action to price rises as a matter of urgency.</p>
