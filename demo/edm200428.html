			<p>That this House acknowledges the work of domestic abuse charity Saje Scotland to protect and support women who have been or are being domestically abused in Fife; understands that Saje Scotland aim to motivate, encourage and enable survivors of domestic abuse to live independently, without fear of abuse, harm or coercion, and to reduce victimisation and prevent re-victimisation by equipping survivors with the right knowledge and tools; further understands that Saje Scotland provide this important service through unique programmes and complementary services such as the Freedom Programme and the Toolkit for Life; notes that the support Saje Scotland provides often results in women removing themselves and their children from harmful situations, thereby reducing the impact on health and social care services; further notes that an external Social Return on Investment evaluation estimated that this work had resulted in a saving of £430,148 to public services; pays credit to the Saje Scotland team for supporting over 18,000 people over the years; expresses concern that some of Saje Scotland’s funding streams have ended, putting the service at risk; and hopes that alternative funding can be sought quickly to secure the future of this vital service so it can continue to support victims of domestic abuse across Fife.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the 125th anniversary of the first ever match between teams from different parts of Spain which took place on 25 April at the Velanova Velodrome between a team made up of Scottish factory workers from the Coats industrial colony at Borgonyá, and a team of players which would go on to help form the modern day FC Barcelona; recognises that the Scottish team was composed of players mainly from the Paisley area, with a teamsheet of Cochrane (captain), Paton, English, Munro, Lyies, Gerard, Cooper, Al. Nicol, A.Tong, H. Tong, Rushtong &amp; King (sub) and that their team, Association Torelló, would go on to become the current club CD Borgonyá; notes that the current club continue to honour their Scots heritage with a small saltire on their black and white jerseys, the only two colours in which the factory thread was dyed, and the same kit design that Paisley team St Mirren play in; acknowledges that around 100 people attended the match, which resulted in a victory for the Barcelona select side; celebrates the Scottish influence on Catalan, Spanish, and wider global footballing history; and wishes CD Borgonyá the best of luck when football matches are resumed.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Newlands</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to act urgently to support the transport industry, many sectors of which have been met with silence from the Department for Transport and the Treasury; urges the Government to listen to representatives of the aviation, road haulage, coaching and holiday travel industry who have made it clear that without urgent action many companies will not survive and many thousands of their workers will be left without a job; asserts that by failing to act now, increased state intervention will be required in the long run in the form of prolonged benefit support, and in event of travel companies collapsing, a huge administrative burden with a bill to match to cover travel consumer protections; and further urges the UK Government to follow the strategy of the Scottish Government on aviation and offer all aviation related businesses 100 per cent business rates relief for a full 12 months.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House notes that 86 per cent of pigs in the UK are slaughtered with high concentrations of CO2; notes that scientific studies report that CO2 causes severe respiratory distress, pain, and hyperventilation and gasping before loss of consciousness; acknowledges that in 2003 the Government’s Farm Animal Welfare Council concluded that the use of high concentrations of CO2 to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable and urged the practice to be phased out in five years; further notes that no such phase out has been implemented; and calls on the Government to increase the research currently being undertaken into alternative methods of slaughter with a view to phasing out stunning with high concentrations of CO2 within five years.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with disappointment the announcement on 16 April 2020 by the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator that the UK Government intends to refuse to extend the EU exit transition period beyond December 2020, risking a no-deal Brexit during a time that the UK, Europe and much of the world will be trying to recover from the public health and economic shock of Covid-19; recognises that the design and delivery of an entirely new arrangement between the UK and the EU will be extremely challenging in the midst of the current crisis; notes that coming out of the transition period without a trade deal during this time when there is already concern around supply of food, medicine and essential equipment could further disrupt vital supply chains; recognises the particular damaging impact this would have on Northern Ireland, risking disruption of all-island co-operation; and calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the EU exit transition period.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern about the extended cut-off date for employees to receive support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, after the eligibility date was extended from 28 February to 19 March; acknowledges that although this extension will allow more employees to now be furloughed following the changes to the Government scheme a large number of workers will still miss out because they are paid towards the end of each month; further notes that all workers who can be furloughed will need to have been on the payroll and the employer would need to have sent to HM Revenue &amp; Customs a real-time information submission notifying a payment in respect of those employees on or before 19 March 2020; believes that this move will not cover people who were not put on the Pay As You Earn system until after the pay cut-off date; and calls on the Government to consider further extending the cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to include this large proportion of workers who are paid monthly and the opportunity for more new employees to be furloughed.</p>

			<p>That this House commends the Chancellor’s job retention schemes to help the employed and the self-employed during the covid-19 outbreak; in addition acknowledges that thousands of people working in a creative freelance capacity are excluded from those schemes; notes that directors of small limited companies that are often comprised of one person cannot access either scheme; further notes that, because of the way the arts industry typically functions, these people usually pay themselves a low salary and rely heavily on dividends; further acknowledges that this means that receiving 80 per cent of their salary, as offered by the schemes set out by the Chancellor, is not enough to live on; and calls on the Government to close the loophole in the job retention schemes by allowing small limited company directors to claim for 80 per cent of filed average earnings, including dividends.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that, for those workers covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it is providing an essential safety net for many workers and their families during this crisis, ensuring businesses can maintain their workforce and enabling them to re-open in the future; notes that the Resolution Foundation estimates that 8 million workers could be furloughed under that scheme; further notes that that whilst Government is funding 80 per cent of the payroll for furloughed staff, employers are not obliged under terms of the scheme to top up the remaining 20 per cent to ensure no loss of pay; remains concerned about the financial impact on workers of receiving only 80 per cent of their usual take home pay, an impact which is particularly difficult for those on low pay; and therefore urges highly profitable corporations like McDonald’s, KFC, and JD Wetherspoons that have made millions  from the labour of those same workers to step up and pay the remaining 20 per cent to ensure that their workers are not forced into debt and further poverty as a result of this significant cut in pay.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that migrant communities, who are disproportionately at risk of exclusion, stigma and discrimination, are not currently receiving the necessary safeguards; further notes that the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians, and Doctors of the World have called on the Government to suspend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 and 2017 and all associated immigration checks and data sharing; believes that it is vital that a clear message is sent to migrant communities that they can seek care when they need it, that they are included in society and have a part to play in response to this crisis; and therefore calls on the Government to suspend all NHS charging for migrants, suspend all data sharing between health services and the Home Office, implement a firewall to ensure that patient data will not be shared with the Home Office or other bodies for the purposes of immigration enforcement, and launch an information campaign to ensure both NHS staff and the public are aware of these changes and that it is safe for people to seek care, particularly aimed at migrant communities across the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises there are loopholes in the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme for new starters; acknowledges that the support offered of 80 per cent of wages up to £2,500 a month is vital for workers during the coronavirus outbreak; recognises that the cut-off date of 19 March 2020 for an employer to submit an RTI notification to HMRC means in practice that people who started jobs in March are exempt from the furlough scheme; believes the Government’s proposed solution for those missed by the scheme to be re-hired by previous employers is inadequate because tight guidelines for furloughing former staff do not fit all circumstances and past employers have no legal requirement to re-hire staff; understands the lack of support offered to new starters means many households are being pushed into debt and destitution; recognises the Government’s aim to combat fraudulent claims through use of a cut-off date, but suggests other methods of doing so, such as submission of employment contracts; notes the strength of feeling among those missed by the scheme who are taking part in the #newstarterfurlough campaigns on social media; and urges the Chancellor to close the loopholes and extend the furlough scheme to new starters.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the tourism sector to the UK economy and that tourism-related businesses lie at the heart of many local communities; notes that this sector has been disproportionally impacted by the covid-19 epidemic; is concerned by reports that in areas of the UK reliant on hospitality and tourism, up to 35 per cent of jobs are permanently at risk because of the pandemic, and that Visit Britain estimates that covid-19 will cost the tourism industry around £15 billion in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK; further notes that a reduced rate of VAT for tourism has long been recommended by three select committees and attracted cross-party support; highlights that the UK is one of only three European countries to have never taken advantage of the EU rules allowing a reduced VAT rate on tourism and that Germany has now cut VAT to 7 per cent to help specific sectors of the economy; calls on the Government to reduce tourism VAT to 5 per cent to help this sector recover from the pandemic, at the same time as strengthening the wider economy, supporting job creation and generating investment in local businesses.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that the details do not reflect the reality of self-employment in the UK; notes that the scheme calculates support based on three years of tax returns and therefore financially penalises those who have worked part time or not at all during that period because of caring responsibilities or maternity/paternity leave, as well as new starters and the recently self-employed; further notes that those who combine PAYE work with being self-employed are not eligible for a proportionate amount of support from the SEISS as well as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; notes that neither profit invested back into the development of self-employed businesses or paid as dividends to directors of small limited companies is counted as income for the purposes of the SEISS and that this is leaving many self-employed people without access to a liveable income; and therefore urges the Government to review the details of the SEISS to correct these anomalies and ensure that the scheme reflects the needs of the more than five million self-employed people in the UK.</p>

			<p>This House notes the increase in use of artificial intelligence and automated-decision-making to recruit, manage and pay workers remotely through the coronavirus pandemic; recognises that learning from past patterns of behaviour to inform decisions about the future increases the risk of deepening inequality for people and groups who are already experiencing disadvantage; further notes that fair access to, and terms of, work is critical at a time when 15 per cent of the workforce have already lost their jobs and over 2 million people are claiming universal credit; expresses concern that the auditing tools most commonly used to assess the risk of discrimination are importing legal standards from the United States which do not reflect the purpose or requirements of the Equality Act 2010; recognises new research from the Institute for the Future of Work which reveals significant limitations in exiting approaches to assessing the impacts of automated systems on equality; and calls on the Government to develop and enforce high industry standards to promote good governance and compliance of the Equality Act, to require regular Equality Impact Assessments as proposed by the Institute for the Future of Work and to review the application and enforcement of the Equality Act to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the intervention by Chris Stark, head of the Climate Change Committee, calling for a reallocation of funding from road-building to broadband; notes the remarks of AA President Edmund King recognising that the crisis may hasten long-term uptake of remote working practices which can increase business efficiency and reduce environmental damage; recognises that 21 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions were emitted from road transport in 2017; acknowledges that the lock-down measures imposed to mitigate covid-19 have led to increased remote working using digital infrastructure; and calls on the Government to urgently review its assessment of road traffic growth and reallocate funding to further the delivery of the universal service obligation for broadband, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the re-balancing of the economy geographically.</p>

			<p>That the House calls on the Government, Association of British Insurers, and regulators to urgently agree an industry-wide scheme to ensure that British citizens who purchased travel insurance for a foreign visit and whose trip has been extended due to the covid-19 pandemic are able to obtain insurance protection for their return journey if they have been refused an extension to their original cover; and to consider how best to extend such a scheme to all UK residents currently stranded abroad.</p>
