			<p>That this House strongly condemns the Government of Bahrain’s increased use of capital punishment, including the recent re-imposition of death sentences against dissidents, Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa; is concerned that that their sentences were based heavily on confessions extracted under torture and that the prosecution failed to present any physical or forensic evidence; that the defendants’ allegations of torture were corroborated by a medical report; expresses further concern about the Foreign Office’s failure to acknowledge evidence of torture and due process violations despite British diplomats monitoring the trial; is aware that there are twelve political prisoners on death row in Bahrain, of whom eight are at risk of imminent execution, having exhausted all legal remedies; that a further twelve individuals are sentenced to death on non-political charges; joins the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions in deeming the execution of five political prisoners in Bahrain since January 2017 to be arbitrary killings, including those of Ali Al-Arab and Ahmed Al-Malali in July 2019; raises concerns about the failure of British taxpayer funding to strengthen the rule of law in Bahrain; reminds the UK Government of its commitment to abolish the death penalty globally, especially given the UK’s prolonged involvement in Bahrain’s so-called justice reform; calls upon the UK Government to condemn the torture of Ramadhan and Moosa and their deeply unfair trial and to suspend its training to bodies accused of human rights violations pending an evaluation of evidence of genuine reform.</p>

			<p>That this House pays tribute to cleaners employed on London Underground and Overground who keep the capital's transport network clear of obstructions, and maintain it in a hygienic state while working unsocial hours in dirty and hazardous conditions; notes that Transport for London continues to use outsourcing companies ABM and Vinci to employ cleaners on London Underground and the Overground rail network; notes with concern that a recent RMT survey of ABM cleaners revealed that the overwhelming majority struggle to make ends meet on low pay, have far worse working conditions than directly employed staff and believe that ABM puts profits ahead of passenger and staff concerns; further notes that the overwhelming majority of cleaners want to be directly employed and brought in-house and believe that bringing all cleaning staff on London's Underground and Overground network in-house will help improve working conditions for this vulnerable group of workers, improve the quality of service for passengers and represent greater economy and efficiency; and urges the Mayor of London to commit to bringing these workers in-house and to convene a working group with the RMT union and other stakeholders to discuss how this can be achieved.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates those who took part in the march of 11 January 2020 in Glasgow in support of Scottish independence; commends the resolute determination of the marchers who braved horrendous weather to make their voices heard; understands that it was estimated that tens of thousands of people participated in the march; respects that these citizens were asserting the nation of Scotland's right to decide to choose its own future; recognises that this follows on from the election of more than 80 per cent of Scotland's MPs standing on a manifesto calling for Scotland's future to be in Scotland's hands; understands that for the first time in history Members elected from the two principal countries within the UK have different constitutional mandates for their respective countries; is mindful of the fact that any denial of the democratic will of the people of Scotland in seeking to determine their own future contradicts principles of equality and ignores the Claim of Right for Scotland, that the people of Scotland have the sovereign right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs; appreciates that this right is well established and was most recently endorsed by the House of Commons in July 2018; and asserts that all attempts to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people to choose their own future are unsustainable.</p>

Members to watch La Dolce Vita, an iconic love letter to his adopted city of Rome; and notes that Fellini’s directorial breadth went further to include surrealist and semi-autobiographical masterpieces including 8½ and Roma which unpicked the social, religious and sexual mores of the era in which Italy redefined itself as an open and vibrant democracy at the heart of European culture.</p>

			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around £10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to £10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid £728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of £9.30 per hour (£10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the decision taken on 10 January 2020 by the United Nations Security Council to cut back essential humanitarian aid to Northern Syria, a decision which exposes four million people to the prospect of a devastating lack of basic daily food stuffs and medicines; is troubled that two of the four access points to Northern Syria for aid have been closed; notes that all aid will now have to cross through the border with Turkey or direct from Government held areas; further notes that the UN Secretary General has stated that the previous programme of aid to Northern Syria was essential; raises concerns that Kurdish people of Syria will be disproportionately affected because of the policies of the Turkish State towards the Kurdish areas, many of which are now under Turkish occupation; and calls for the United Nations Security Council to reverse this dangerous decision and for all parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, and to broker a negotiated settlement which protects the rights of all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the inauguration of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong to promote democracy and the rule of law, and to defend human rights in Hong Kong, to share information about Hong Kong, and to nurture relations between the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong; notes that the inaugural meeting heard chilling testimony from a consultant surgeon who provides humanitarian aid to those injured in the protests, including police, protestors and bystanders, and who reported having treated the kind of injuries seen in wars; is profoundly concerned by reports of the arrest and public humiliation of those providing medical assistance to the injured; observes that video footage of police brutality demonstrates that the Hong Kong police are failing to adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Guidance on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement; further observes that the arrest of those providing humanitarian assistance is contrary to international law and the global consensus on fundamental human rights of access to medical treatment; is alarmed that failure of the international community to condemn these breaches by the Hong Kong police would set a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, placing in grave jeopardy the lives and welfare of humanitarian aid workers around the world, including providers of medical and other aid from the United Kingdom; and calls on the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to raise these concerns with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Catholic Church’s focus on Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities for Racial Justice Sunday on 9 February 2020; recognises the valuable contribution that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities make to the Church and to wider society; notes with concern that over three-quarters of people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities have experienced hate speech or hate crimes; further notes that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities experience the worst health, education and employment outcomes of any ethnic group; and calls on the Government to take urgent action to address the discrimination and inequalities these communities face. </p>

			<p>That this House congratulates South Cowal Community Enterprise and all the residents of the villages of Toward and Innellan on the South Cowal peninsular who, following a two-year campaign and with the assistance of the Scottish Land Fund saved their local village shop and Post Office, The Lido from closure; acknowledges the remarkable contribution from the people of Cowal who raised £68,000 through a community share offer which enabled the business to be transferred into community ownership; recognises the importance of local shops and Post Offices to the sustainability and viability of rural communities; wishes The Lido every success in the future; and hopes that other communities facing the loss of vital services will be inspired by what has been achieved by the South Cowal Community Development Company and people of Toward and Innellan and be encouraged to explore the option of community ownership.</p>
