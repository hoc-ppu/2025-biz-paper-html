			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carolyn Harris</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the poor mental health, including feelings of depression and anxiety, experienced by nearly half of people after a bereavement as revealed in Sue Ryder’s recent survey; notes that this is partly a result of a lack of conversation in society around grief with a third of bereaved people feeling unable to talk openly about their loss; recognises the reluctance of people to start a conversation with someone who is bereaved with over half being scared they would say the wrong thing and nearly half not knowing what to say; commends Sue Ryder for launching the #JustSaySomething campaign; encourages people who have been bereaved to open up to their support network and ask for help from their GP if they need it, those supporting someone struggling with their grief to encourage conversation and be ready to listen and for people supporting those who are grieving to find tips on how to do this on the Sue Ryder website; and further recognises the role of public figures in society in facilitating and encouraging everyone dealing with bereavement to talk freely when they want to and to create as compassionate a society as possible.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patrick Grady</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned by the slow implementation of many areas of the Peace Accord in Colombia, including rural reform, crop substitution and victims’ rights to justice which lie at the root of the conflict, as well as the often disproportionate use of force by officials in response to social protest; notes with alarm that areas vacated by the FARC have been filled by other illegal armed groups and militarised more generally, resulting in local populations being marginalised and threatened; urges the Colombian Government to comply with Resolution 1190/2018 of the Ministry of the Interior when addressing social protest, to seriously consider making the National Police accountable to civilian authorities rather than the Ministry of Defence, to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of on-going attacks and killings of social leaders and human rights defenders, and to implement all elements of the Peace Accord, as well as territorial development plans (PDETs); and calls on the Government to closely monitor spending by the Colombian Government of the UK’s funding for the implementation of the Peace Accord, to continue playing a key role on the UN Security Council on Colombia, including with the Verification Mission, whose mandate should be renewed for a further three years, and to continue supporting the Colombian Government and civil society in fully implementing the Peace Accord to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>

Members to support the National Deaf Children’s Society Deaf Works Everywhere campaign, which has just launched, to get more deaf young people into work and into jobs that inspire them.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the decision taken on 10 January 2020 by the United Nations Security Council to cut back essential humanitarian aid to Northern Syria, a decision which exposes four million people to the prospect of a devastating lack of basic daily food stuffs and medicines; is troubled that two of the four access points to Northern Syria for aid have been closed; notes that all aid will now have to cross through the border with Turkey or direct from Government held areas; further notes that the UN Secretary General has stated that the previous programme of aid to Northern Syria was essential; raises concerns that Kurdish people of Syria will be disproportionately affected because of the policies of the Turkish State towards the Kurdish areas, many of which are now under Turkish occupation; and calls for the United Nations Security Council to reverse this dangerous decision and for all parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, and to broker a negotiated settlement which protects the rights of all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the inauguration of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong to promote democracy and the rule of law, and to defend human rights in Hong Kong, to share information about Hong Kong, and to nurture relations between the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong; notes that the inaugural meeting heard chilling testimony from a consultant surgeon who provides humanitarian aid to those injured in the protests, including police, protestors and bystanders, and who reported having treated the kind of injuries seen in wars; is profoundly concerned by reports of the arrest and public humiliation of those providing medical assistance to the injured; observes that video footage of police brutality demonstrates that the Hong Kong police are failing to adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Guidance on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement; further observes that the arrest of those providing humanitarian assistance is contrary to international law and the global consensus on fundamental human rights of access to medical treatment; is alarmed that failure of the international community to condemn these breaches by the Hong Kong police would set a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, placing in grave jeopardy the lives and welfare of humanitarian aid workers around the world, including providers of medical and other aid from the United Kingdom; and calls on the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to raise these concerns with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises and celebrates the importance of vibrant oceans to our global ecosystem; notes that our oceans are facing a variety of threats, including large amounts of waste of all kinds being disposed of in them, overfishing and human caused climate change, and that the creatures within them are especially vulnerable to even slight changes in global temperatures; regrets that studies have found that only 13 per cent of the ocean has been unharmed by human activity, that 50 per cent of global coral has died since 1980, that 72 marine species are listed as critically endangered, and that over a third of marine mammal species face extinction; recalls the work of the Blue Belt Programme in UK Overseas Territories; welcomes the Greenpeace Ocean Declaration on the ongoing negotiations towards a Global Ocean Treaty and calls upon the Government to be bold in pursuing meaningful negotiations to establish, significantly expand and enforce global ocean sanctuaries, and to drive a global shift towards a collaborative, but also effective, global decision making process to help protect global oceans.</p>

			<p>That this House commends successful businessman Julian Richer for launching the Zero Hours Justice campaign to provide advice and legal support for workers forced to work on a zero hours basis; believes that good employers recognise that their staff deserve financial security and the ability budget effectively from week to week; notes that responsible employers have no difficulty in offering workers the option of contracts which offer them a guaranteed minimum number of paid hours each week; is concerned that the use of zero hours contracts can deter workers from raising serious abuses in the workplace including bullying, sexual harassment and health and safety breaches; and calls on all public bodies to eliminate the use of exploitative zero hours contracts, both for directly-employed and privately-contracted workers.</p>

			<p>This House supports the growth of electric vehicle sales; notes that Government funded grants for electric cars have been running since 2011 and that battery electric vehicles now represent 1.6 per cent of new car sales in the UK; further notes that those grants are due to end in March 2020 and that when the Government grant for plug-in hybrid cars ended in April last year sales fell by 50 per cent; recognises that in 2020 carmakers do not need to sell electric vehicles in the UK market to meet their EU targets and that if the grant is removed, those companies would be incentivised to instead sell their vehicles where market conditions are easier and grants are available; further recognises the importance of those grants for public health and reaching net-zero emissions; and calls upon the Government to continue grants for electric cars in the March 2020 Budget for a further five years and to invest in charging infrastructure.</p>

			<p>That this House supports members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) employed by Interserve at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who will embark on a month of strike action throughout February 2020; notes that this dispute has been ongoing since March 2019 over issues including pay, trade union recognition, removal of working hours for cleaners and sick pay; further notes that the last strike ballot in October 2019 returned a 100 per cent vote in support of further strike action on an 82.5 per cent turnout; commends the efforts of PCS in their attempts throughout this dispute to seek resolution via the conciliator, ACAS, and their calls for urgent meetings with the employer and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs during the most recent ballot period; is concerned that treatment of staff employed by Interserve at the FCO has worsened in recent months, with those involved in the dispute excluded from festive activities and attempts being made by their employer to close their designated break room; notes that no worker takes the decision to go on strike lightly; and therefore calls on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to bring an end to this dispute and ensure all workers in Government are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges the success of St Paul’s Youth Forum in the North East of Glasgow on reducing gang related violence by 97 per cent since 2006; recognises the number of youth crimes reduced from 116 in 2006 to just two in 2016 and understands they achieved this by investing just £80,000 a year in dedicated youth work; applauds the breadth of work undertaken by the young people and youth workers, from the health and wellbeing project where vegetables are grown and eaten locally to the youth led local radio station BOLT FM, and from On Bikes which enables young people to make use of and repair bicycles to youth exchange trips from Blackhill and Provanmill to Zambia; endorses the approach of empowering young people to take on responsibility for the project; and applauds trustees of the board and the dedicated staff and volunteers led by Neil Young.</p>

			<p>That this House is very concerned by the crackdown on peaceful protest and the media in The Gambia, following the use of excessive force by security forces last month to disperse protesters calling for President Adama Barrow to fulfil his pledge to step down after three years in power, resulting in many injuries and three deaths, as well as the closure of two FM radio stations and charges of incitement brought against at least two journalists; notes that despite some progress since the departure of former President Yahya Jammeh, allegedly responsible for forced disappearances, rape and murder during two decades of authoritarian rule, serious human rights violations still need to be addressed and accountability mechanisms strengthened; urges the Gambian Government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens, including by unconditionally releasing all those detained for exercising their right to peaceful protest, reopening radio stations it closed and releasing detained journalists; and calls on the Government, with the international community, to support the Gambian Government and civil society in the transition from dictatorship to democracy, as well as to engage with them under the auspices of the UK’s current Global Media Freedom campaign.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the overturning by the High Court of Justice Tolson’s ruling in the Central Family Court that a sexual assault did not constitute rape because the woman had taken no physical step to encourage the man to desist; notes with concern the High Court’s findings that Justice Tolson failed to apply the definitions of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour, dismissed or ignored reports from the police, failed to allow the Appellant to make her full submission and repeatedly interrupted her; further notes with concern the High Court’s findings on Justice Tolson’s judgment that the real risk of the appearance of a partisan approach in that judge’s conduct was self-evident and that the fact that the judge preferred the Respondent’s case was patent throughout his judgment; highlights the High Court’s further findings that Justice Tolson’s reasons for dismissing the evidence of the Appellant were wrong, specifically, that he made a finding regarding the Appellant’s psychological state of mind without any forensic expert evidence; further highlights that the High Court found that Justice Tolson’s approach towards the issue of consent was manifestly at odds with current jurisprudence, concomitant sexual behaviour, and what is currently acceptable socio-sexual conduct; notes with concern that Justice Tolson continues to preside over cases involving domestic abuse and rape in the Family Courts; and calls on the Government to take steps with the Judicial College to ensure that training is made mandatory for family court and criminal court judges on the legally correct and appropriate approach to take when hearing domestic abuse and sexual assault allegations.</p>
