			<p>That this House congratulates those who took part in the march of 11 January in Glasgow in support of Scottish Independence; commends the resolute determination of the marchers who braved horrendous weather to make their voices heard; understands that it was estimated that tens of thousands of people participated in the march; respects that these citizens were asserting the nation of Scotland's right to decide to choose its own future; recognises that this follows on from the election of more than 80 per cent of Scotland's MPs standing on a manifesto calling for Scotland's future to be in Scotland's hands; understands that for the first time in history Members elected from the two principal countries within the UK have different constitutional mandates for their respective countries; is mindful of the fact that any denial of the democratic will of the people of Scotland in seeking to determine their own future contradicts principles of equality and ignores the Claim of Right for Scotland, that the people of Scotland have the sovereign right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs; appreciates that this Right is well established and was most recently endorsed by the House of Commons in July 2018; and asserts that all attempts to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people to choose their own future are unsustainable.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement in the Queen’s Speech that the Mental Health Act will be reformed; agrees that current legislation is out of step with a modern mental healthcare system and that people must have a service that affords them the dignity and respect that they deserve; further notes that the announcement made no mention of the urgent needs of children; contends that unless their needs are embedded into a new Mental Health Act as a central priority such legislation will be fundamentally flawed; calls on the Government to guarantee that new mental health legislation will focus on children’s needs and protect them, ensure that services are provided by a properly qualified workforce, reflect policies that are informed by the best available evidence; and further calls on the Government to focus on the needs of parents and carers and guarantee to bring forward such legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

Members to watch La Dolce Vita, an iconic love letter to his adopted city of Rome; and notes that Fellini’s directorial breadth went further to include surrealist and semi-autobiographical masterpieces including 8½ and Roma which unpicked the social, religious and sexual mores of the era in which Italy redefined itself as an open and vibrant democracy at the heart of European culture.</p>

			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around £10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to £10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid £728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of £9.30 per hour (£10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Government's public consultation on controls on the import and export of hunting trophies; notes the strong cross-party support for EDM 1829, Session 2017-19 and that 86 per cent of the British public support an end to trophy hunting; further notes that most UK trophy imports are of threatened species and that the number of trophy imports from captive-bred animals is growing; believes that trophy hunting has had devastating impacts on some wildlife populations and that the pursuit of animals with the largest tusks, horns, or antlers is resulting in artificial selection which imperils the survival of these species; further believes that trophy hunting fees rarely provide substantive funding for conservation or benefits to local communities; is strongly of the view that killing animals for trophies is indefensible and cruel and that it has no place in the modern world; urges policy-makers to work with stakeholders to support sustainable economic development that creates real prosperity for people through preserving our natural heritage; and calls on the Government to implement a comprehensive ban on trophy hunting imports and exports as quickly as possible, to consider an immediate moratorium, and to work with other Governments to help bring an end to trophy hunting.</p>

			<p>That this House is aware that the hormone pregnancy drug test, Primodos, was taken by approximately 1.5 million women in the 1960s and 1970s to test for pregnancy; understands that there is considerable evidence that many women who took this drug either gave birth to babies with serious deformities, miscarried, or had stillbirths, with the babies affected now in their 40s and 50s, having experienced a lifetime with serious disabilities; seeks answers as to why no official warnings were issued about this drug until eight years after the first major report that indicated possible dangers; is alarmed that some doctors were still prescribing this drug for pregnant women after official warnings were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines; has deep concerns about the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-led expert working group's review of this issue which seems to have been shrouded in secrecy; urges the UK Government to fully respond to concerns raised about the methodology of this review, the independence of the panel members, the conclusions of the report and the fact that key information seems to have been withheld from the report in order to suggest that there is no link between Primodos and birth defects; welcomes the announcement by the former Prime Minister in February 2018 of a review of this scandal involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos; and urges the current Prime Minister to ensure that a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter is established without delay, to ensure justice for those affected.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the growing body of evidence, including research reports by Doctors of the World, Maternity Action and the British Medical Association, that the NHS England overseas visitors charging regime is deterring vulnerable migrant women living in the UK from seeking essential maternity care; is further concerned that the MBRRACE-UK report, Saving Lives, Improving Mothers’ Care 2019, published on 13 December 2019, links the charging regime and a possible fear of being charged to the deaths of three women who delayed seeking critical antenatal care in 2015-17; notes that the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Midwives have all urged ministers to suspend the charging regime pending a full independent review of its impact on individual and public health; further notes that less than 40 per cent of the total sum of charges levied in England in recent years has actually been recovered by the NHS; agrees with the stated view of the Royal College of Midwives that the Government has a duty to give the NHS the resources it needs and should not be using NHS clinicians to patrol our borders; and urges the Government to respond positively to Maternity Action’s call, supported by the Royal College of Midwives, for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the publication of the Online Harms White Paper in April 2019 and subsequent assurances by the Government that they will introduce a robust regulator to safeguard children online; further notes that over 45,000 people signed the NSPCC’s Wild West Web petition calling for statutory regulation so that social networks have a legal duty of care to protect every child from abuse online; and notes the urgent need for Government action as data obtained by the NSPCC shows that over the last year an average of 11 child sexual offences occurred each day over just three commonly-used social network platforms; notes that the Home Office estimates that 80,000 adults in the UK poses a sexual threat to children online; recognises that due to the pressing need for change and the time it would take to set up a new regulator that an interim regulator should be appointed to fill the regulatory gap while more long-term measures are being put in place; and calls on the Government to bring in legislation as promised to assign a duty of care regulator to keep children safe online as a matter of urgency, and, in the interim, to support Lord McNally's Private Member's Bill, introduced on 14 January 2020 into the House of Lords, which instructs Ofcom to start preparing for the new regime.</p>

			<p>That this House pays tribute to cleaners employed on London Underground and Overground who keep the capital's transport network clear of obstructions, and maintain it in a hygienic state while working unsocial hours in dirty and hazardous conditions; notes that Transport for London continues to use outsourcing companies ABM and Vinci to employ cleaners on London Underground and the Overground rail network; notes with concern that a recent RMT survey of ABM cleaners revealed that the overwhelming majority struggle to make ends meet on low pay, have far worse working conditions than directly employed staff and believe that ABM puts profits ahead of passenger and staff concerns; further notes that the overwhelming majority of cleaners want to be directly employed and brought in-house and believe that bringing all cleaning staff on London's Underground and Overground network in-house will help improve working conditions for this vulnerable group of workers, improve the quality of service for passengers and represent greater economy and efficiency; and urges the Mayor of London to commit to bringing these workers in-house and to convene a working group with the RMT union and other stakeholders to discuss how this can be achieved.</p>
