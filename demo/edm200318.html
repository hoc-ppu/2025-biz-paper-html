			<p>That this House notes that several thousand of residents in each Parliamentary constituency use medical devices and catheters successfully to manage urinary incontinence and maintain quality of life; welcomes the significant decreases in deaths through improvements in medical devices and catheterisation techniques; acknowledges that those improvements have been underpinned by Part IX of the Drug Tariff which provides fixed prices for safe and effective products; supports the long-standing policy that clinicians have the right and duty to prescribe products on that list are most appropriate for each patient; further notes the introduction of large numbers of more limited lists of products through local formularies and frameworks by NHS trusts, care commissioning groups and NHS Supply Chain; notes that those lists often fail to emphasise the importance of clinician access to the full range of products on Part IX, undermining clinical freedom and patient choice and putting a strain on the NHS through avoidable admissions for urinary tract infections; and calls on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to make a commitment to Part IX of the Drug Tariff and to ensure that NHS England complies with formularies and frameworks for continence products in relation to Part IX of the Drug Tariff.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that as a result of the covid-19 outbreak, a number of countries have closed their borders to contain the virus; notes that as a result many UK subjects are stranded; calls on the Government to negotiate with all countries where borders have closed, ways of repatriating UK nationals, in particular the most vulnerable; and calls on the UK Government to utilise civilian and military assets where appropriate to facilitate repatriation.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir David Amess</span></p>
			<p>That this House urges the Government to introduce legislation to ban the imports and sales of real fur products; notes that the UK has long banned the main methods of fur so-called production, namely leg-hold trapping and fur factory farming, due to their inherent cruelty; believes that, in view of these bans, it is hypocritical to continue to allow the import of real fur; further notes that the fur industry in the UK has significantly declined over the last 40 years, is now rejected by the majority of global fashion houses and UK high street retailers, and that fur sales are soon to be banned in California; acknowledges that there is a political and legal opportunity for a fur ban with the UK leaving the European Union; further acknowledges that there is widespread public support for a fur ban; and further believes that a fur ban is a natural extension of the existing import bans on cat and dog fur and commercial seal products, and that a comprehensive fur ban will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the promotion of animal welfare.</p>

			<p>That this House supports employee share ownership and believes that such schemes reward loyalty and hard work by giving employees a real stake in their company with tax breaks; commends the Social Market Foundation's report entitled Strengthening Employee Ownership in the UK; notes that the Roadchef Employee Benefits Trust, the first tax exempt all-employee share ownership scheme of its kind in the UK approved by the then UK Government and HMRC, was missed from the list of all-employee share ownership schemes that currently benefit from tax breaks under existing legislation because it was stripped of its assets by Roadchef's former CEO in breach of trust; further notes that Trustees subsequently recovered compensation from HMRC and the former CEO but are prevented from distributing this vital money to approximately 4,000 beneficiaries, mainly low-paid former and current cleaning and catering staff of Roadchef, because HMRC are still considering what taxes to charge the Trust and its beneficiaries; believes this dispute could be swiftly resolved by correcting existing legislation to add the Trust to the list of all-employee share ownership schemes and to ensure that schemes of this nature do not lose their tax exempt status where the trustee has restored monies to the Trust following a breach of trust as in the Roadchef case; and calls on the UK Government to propose an amendment to existing legislation in the Finance Bill to ensure that beneficiaries under the Roadchef scheme are exempt from tax as intended by previous Labour and Conservative Governments and to expedite payouts quickly.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of quality local journalism; commends those who dedicate their working lives to serving the public by reporting important, timely and accurate information that is in the public interest; notes the importance of media reporting and how it helps to maintain local transparency and accountability and supports the health of democracy at a local level; celebrates that, from reporting on floods or courts, to covering significant community events and issues, the work done by local journalists is essential in sustaining public life; and therefore resolves to support the National Union of Journalists' Local News Matters campaign, and further consider ways in which additional investment, resources and support for local journalism can be encouraged in order to protect the future viability and sustainability of local quality news.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises International Bagpipe Day on March 10, a day initiated by the Bagpipe Society to celebrate the diversity of the world’s bagpiping traditions and promote this historic instrument to new players around the globe; notes that over 130 different kinds of pipes are played worldwide, with the earliest pipe carvings reported on Middle Eastern Hittite Stones dating from 1000 BC; celebrates the vibrancy of bagpiping traditions across Scotland with talented local pipe bands such as Glencorse in Midlothian making sure this distinctive and powerful sound continues to inspire audiences across the generations; and supports calls for a bagpipe emoji to be established on social media sites to recognise the universal appeal of this ancient, iconic instrument.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that each year, thousands of animals including monkeys, mice, pigs and guinea pigs are experimented on using chemical, biological and other weapons, causing prolonged and extensive suffering; notes that while these experiments are not conducted to develop or test offensive weapons, suffering can continue for hours until the animal dies or is killed; further notes that examples of the symptoms of warfare experiments include bleeding genitals, writhing, substantial incapacitation, gasping, continuous tremor and visible production of saliva; highlights that the suffering is in addition to the standard deprivations of life in a laboratory that include restrictions on movement, inability to choose cage-mates and stress induced by human presence, light and sound; further notes that in 2018 at Porton Down, 1,941 animals were experimented upon for warfare experiments and that 30.2 per cent of those experiments  were classified as severe which resulted in the highest level of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm; and calls on the Government to introduce a ban on the use of live animals for warfare experiments.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern that the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardising the work and income as well as the health of many people, including the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts; notes that the Government’s revised sick pay policy announced in the budget does not expand eligibility for statutory sick pay, and that an estimated 2 million workers would remain excluded and reliant on employment and support allowance or universal credit; further notes that these arrangements and the low level of sick pay, currently just £94.25 per week, will expose many workers and their families to financial hardship and uncertainty; recognises the increased risk to public health this poses as people are forced to remain in the workforce on economic grounds even when this is contrary to public health or medical advice; further recognises the findings of research by the Institute for the Future of Work, which indicates that boosting the statutory floor of protection would support social and economic resilience; calls for emergency legislation to introduce statutory sick pay for all as a contribution to dealing with the worst public health crisis in a generation; and further calls on the Government to initiate cross-departmental work on a policy framework for socially responsible, human-centred employment, including a review of basic statutory protection for the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern regarding water quality in northern Sri Lanka; is concerned by reports stating that the Sri Lankan Government refused to allow independent assessments of water quality in the region; notes that the consumption or use of water contaminated by waste oil has been linked to many diseases and birth defects; calls for steps to be taken to allow all citizens in northern Sri Lanka, the majority of whom are Tamils, to have access to clean drinking water; calls on the area around the Chunnakam power plant complex to be subjected to a full independent investigation; and believes that all citizens affected by water contamination should be provided with competent medical follow-up and be compensated adequately by the Sri Lankan Government.</p>
