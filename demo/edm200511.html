			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that many supply teachers are still facing significant anxiety due to a lack of clarity from the Government with regards to furlough during the covid-19 outbreak; notes that with schools set to reopen in a phased manner many supply teachers will rely on the welfare system for the foreseeable future; believes that the Government needs to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that supply teachers are provided with the financial relief they need; calls on the Government to ensure that all supply teachers, regardless of how they are employed, receive 80 per cent of their true average earnings when furloughed; and further calls on the Government to create a dedicated separate webpage for supply teachers to provide them with guidance and advice in one place, work with supply agencies and schools to clearly communicate responsibilities and reassure schools wanting to keep supply teachers that funding will be available for them to do so.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned with the increasing financial pressures being felt by struggling families as a result of the coronavirus; recognises that energy bills are estimated to increase by an average of £32 a month or almost £400 a year due to increased energy usage during lockdown; understands that the vast majority of people do not change energy suppliers for a variety of reasons and an estimated 16 million homes are overpaying for energy on the standard variable tariff with one of the six biggest energy providers; acknowledges that high energy costs have a serious impact on people’s finances, coming at a time when many face losing their jobs and livelihoods and are facing real financial difficulties on reduced incomes; appreciates that reduced incomes and increased costs will lead many families to borrow to get by, potentially plunging millions of households into further financial difficulty; and calls on the Government to do all it can to support more households to switch to cheaper energy suppliers to help ease those pressures during this time of national crisis.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the awarding of the contract for the clean-up of radioactive material at Dalgety Bay beach by the Ministry of Defence earlier this year; notes that the beach became contaminated with radioactive particles originating from the instrument panels of military aircraft dumped at the site after WWII; observes that the contamination was first discovered in 1990 during a SEPA survey and that the clean-up operation has experienced repeated delays since the MoD was appointed the Appropriate Person responsible for remediation in 2013; understands that the work is set to include clearing the beach of contaminated material and installing a barrier to prevent other material rising to the surface from the sea bed; believes that the first phase of remediation works is due to commence imminently; pays tribute to numerous local community representatives who have pursued this matter doggedly, including Councillors David Barratt and Alice McGarry, and former hon. Member Roger Mullin, all of whom have worked tirelessly to push the MoD to progress this longstanding project; and urges the UK Government to take every possible step to reduce the risk of any potential delay to the commencement of those works as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the plans of the new Israeli coalition government to annex part of the occupied West Bank; further notes that Israeli legislation can progress from 1 July 2020 to carry out such an annexation; highlights that any such annexation of territory occupied in 1967 is a breach of international law which rejects any acquisition of territory through force and that it would be a major threat to peace; notes that when Russia illegally annexed the Crimea in 2014, the UK joined EU partners in imposing sanctions on that country; calls on the Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that such a step will have severe consequences for the UK-Israel relationship; and further calls on the Government to introduce sanctions similar to those impose on Russia in the event that an annexation of occupied territory takes place.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the tourism sector to the UK economy and that tourism-related businesses lie at the heart of many local communities; notes that this sector has been disproportionally impacted by the covid-19 epidemic; is concerned by reports that in areas of the UK reliant on hospitality and tourism, up to 35 per cent of jobs are permanently at risk because of the pandemic, and that Visit Britain estimates that covid-19 will cost the tourism industry around £15 billion in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK; further notes that a reduced rate of VAT for tourism has long been recommended by three select committees and attracted cross-party support; highlights that the UK is one of only three European countries to have never taken advantage of the EU rules allowing a reduced VAT rate on tourism and that Germany has now cut VAT to 7 per cent to help specific sectors of the economy; calls on the Government to reduce tourism VAT to 5 per cent to help this sector recover from the pandemic, at the same time as strengthening the wider economy, supporting job creation and generating investment in local businesses.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that any SME occupying premises with a rateable value of more than £51,000 is excluded from the Small Business Grants Fund (SBGF) and Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund (RHLGF); believes that this criteria is unfair to a wide range of SMEs, including those for whom landlords are the ratepayers and those who collectively occupy premises over the rateable value threshold with a number of other business; further notes that, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, there are 10,000 pubs still without any grant support because they are above the £51,000 rateable value threshold; and therefore calls on the Government to remove the rateable value criteria and instead open up the SRGF and the RHLGF to all SMEs and pubs.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that the details do not reflect the reality of self-employment in the UK; notes that the scheme calculates support based on three years of tax returns and therefore financially penalises those who have worked part time or not at all during that period because of caring responsibilities or maternity/paternity leave, as well as new starters and the recently self-employed; further notes that those who combine PAYE work with being self-employed are not eligible for a proportionate amount of support from the SEISS as well as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; notes that neither profit invested back into the development of self-employed businesses or paid as dividends to directors of small limited companies is counted as income for the purposes of the SEISS and that this is leaving many self-employed people without access to a liveable income; and therefore urges the Government to review the details of the SEISS to correct these anomalies and ensure that the scheme reflects the needs of the more than five million self-employed people in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to £5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women’s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to £3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of €10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House applauds the excellent work of consumer organisation Which? in its investigations into price-gouging during the Covid19 crisis; is deeply concerned with the recent trend of unreasonable hikes in the prices of essential items by online retailers due to the covid-19 pandemic, a practice known as price gouging; understands that there have been reports of excessive price rises for essential items such as cleaning products and baby formula, due to the coronavirus crisis, particularly through online retailers such as eBay and Amazon; is shocked by the findings of Which? that there has been a 1000 per cent increase in the prices of products like Dettol cleaning spray by some third party sellers online and in response has launched an app to help people more easily report coronavirus profiteering; urges people to report any instances of price gouging of which they become aware; condemns those seeking to make excessive profits at the time of a global health crisis, which will cause huge difficulties for those in need of some basic essential items; understands that large online retailers like eBay and Amazon are now working to address price gouging and urges them to do more to do more to monitor and regulate what their sellers are charging; and calls on the Government to introduce stronger regulations to prevent this price gouging and give the Competition and Markets Authority greater powers to investigate and tackle this important issue.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the tremendous effort of the Fife Voluntary Action Helping Hand service in supporting communities in response to the covid-19 outbreak, working to match volunteers to existing community and resilience groups or to individual tasks; thanks the 1800 members of the public who have come forward to volunteer to assist with a range of emergency responses throughout Fife, from telephone befriending to food and medical deliveries; pays tribute to all of the organisations that have been involved throughout the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, including Fife Council, Kirkcaldy Foodbank, Benarty Emergency Response Team, Benarty Foodbank, Lochgelly Beat Corona Group, and Burntisland Action Group; recognises the importance of local food projects, including Max’s Meals and Community Fridge in Cowdenbeath, Linktown Tenants and Residents Association, Linton Lane Centre and Hug A Mug Coffee Shop who have been delivering food to people shielding, and EATS Rosyth who have expanded to new areas including Aberdour and Dalgety Bay; credits the efforts to work with over 80 pharmacies across the region, with volunteer drivers uplifting and delivering prescriptions to people most at risk due to Coronavirus; and congratulates Fife Voluntary Action on the success of its crowdfunder, which has raised more than £45,000 to pay for essential items such as food, gas or electricity for the most vulnerable.</p>
