			<p>That this House notes World Obesity Day 2020; recognises that weight stigma has a negative effect on the lives of people with obesity and exacerbates levels of obesity overall; understands that action is needed to change the way people view obesity to recognise that it is not always the fault of the individual; and endorses the Parliamentary Guidelines launched by the all-party Parliamentary group on obesity to support Parliamentarians to speak about obesity in a non-stigmatising manner.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK’s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering £100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the pressures on HMRC arising from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, including the possibility of greater variation in customs and tariff arrangements, makes it imperative that retention of staff expertise is prioritised; further notes that the proximity of HMRC’s Ealing office to Heathrow airport makes it a strategically important location in allowing tax officers to link up with Border Force officials; regrets that management proposals to close the Ealing office will result in the loss of many highly-qualified and experienced members of staff who are unable to relocate to the new Regional Hub in Stratford; offers support and solidarity to members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union taking industrial action to protest at the planned closure; and therefore calls on HMRC management to suspend the existing plan to close the site and seek agreement over alternative arrangements.</p>

			<p>That this House notes press reports that rugby union's Six Nations tournament could be put behind a TV pay wall after decades on free to air public broadcasting services; believes the annual tournament should be placed in the Government's Category A of sporting events which must be made available live on free-to-air platforms; recognises that the Six Nations, which began in 1883 as the Home Nations, is one of the oldest and most historic sports tournaments in the world with a special place in the sporting and social culture of Ireland, Scotland, England and particularly Wales; notes the large TV audiences which this year's tournament has already attracted on terrestrial TV with a peak of seven million viewers watching the opening weekend's fixtures accounting for an audience share of 41 per cent; considers the generations of young people who have been inspired to take up the sport after watching the tournament on terrestrial television; and calls on all interested parties to ensure that the Six Nations remains on free to air TV.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by reports that changes by the Home Office to Tier 4 visa regulations have adversely impacted many teams in the Scottish Women’s Premier League and potentially those in other sports; notes the changes have resulted in non-EU international students already studying in the UK now being unable to play sports on a completely amateur basis if even one player in that competition is playing in a professional or semi-professional basis; feels that this is a very blunt measure entirely lacking in common sense which places unnecessary restrictions on women’s football at a time when every support should be in place to encourage the sport to grow; and calls on the Home Office to urgently review the regulations to ensure that no one on a Tier 4 visa be restricted should they want to play sport without any financial remuneration.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that Six Nations organisers have refused to rule out the possibility of the tournament going behind a £300 million pay per view paywall in 2022 following the start of a new broadcast rights period; believes that by ruling out joint bids by terrestrial broadcasters Six Nations officials are making it inevitable that the rights to broadcast the tournament will be secured by a pay-to-view subscription service; is concerned that this move risks losing an audience that has been built up and will stymie the ability of the sport to attract young players to the game; notes that the Six Nations tournament has a long tradition of being aired on free-to-view television in the UK and that any decision that would limit access would be a retrograde step; calls on the Six Nations organisers to reconsider their decision on allowing joint broadcaster bids; and further calls on the Government to ensure that the long-cherished Six Nations tournament is given full protection under Group A listed event status.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the investigation carried out by BBC One’s Inside Out programme screened on 24 February 2020 into the levels of exposure to air pollutants experienced by workers in  drive-through fast-food restaurants; notes that research by Professor Anitha K Chinnaswamy of the Centre for Business in Society based at Coventry University found that vehicle emissions are a major source of nitrogen dioxide and airborne particle-matter, exposure to which can cause very harmful health effects including respiratory illnesses, asthma, lung disorders, but also hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; encourages owners of drive-through restaurants such as McDonalds to fund further investigations into air quality levels and the short and long term impact of employees' exposure to pollutants in booths and windows in close proximity to sources of vehicle exhaust fumes;  and further encourages such employers to work with the relevant trades unions including the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union to ensure that all reasonable precautionary measures are taken to protect workers from the impact of such exposure.</p>
