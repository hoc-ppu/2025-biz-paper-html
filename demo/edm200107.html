			<p>That this House notes with concern the previous Government’s plans to extend the off-payroll (IR35) changes to the private sector, despite the damage that this has done to the public sector including the NHS; further notes that the off-payroll tax means a 14.3 per cent extra cost on UK business made up of National Insurance and the Apprenticeship Levy; believes that this will damage the UK’s flexible workforce and the UK economy, driving up project costs and depriving businesses of access to key skills; notes that firms are already laying off self-employed contractors and that others are looking to offshore resource to avoid the extra costs; further notes that HMRC estimate that 153,000 UK contractors could lose up 25 per cent of their pay and that thousands of contractors will be asked to pay their clients employment tax bills, without getting the benefits of employment such as sick and holiday pay and a pension contribution; is concerned that the off-payroll tax will lead to tax non-compliance and the danger of people being lured into avoidance schemes, as happened with those now facing the loan charge; welcomes the commitment made by the Chancellor to hold an IR35 review made during the election, but believes this is will only be a genuine review if the roll-out is halted; and therefore calls for an immediate halt to the off-payroll tax roll-out and announcement of an independent review looking into how best to recognise contracting and freelancing in the tax system..</p>

			<p>That this House affirms its commitment to the Global Goals for Sustainable Development agreed by Member States of the United Nations in 2015 with the aim of ending poverty, fighting inequality and addressing the urgency of climate change by 2030;  believes the United Kingdom’s statutory commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income each year as Official Development Assistance demonstrates cross-party consensus in the UK behind the importance of those goals, and ambitious leadership among the international community of donor countries; further believes that the existence since 1997 of a dedicated Government Department and Secretary of State for International Development has protected and enhanced the work of Government and thousands of agencies and charities funded by Government, in meeting global targets to end poverty; and believes that the Department for International Development should continue to exist as a dedicated Government Department throughout the lifetime of this Parliament and beyond.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the number of people living in blocks with  cladding (both ACM and HPL) which has either been identified as unsafe or has yet to be inspected; is aware that a growing number of people are currently unable to sell their homes because of this problem; believes that these leaseholders should not have to pay for the cost of inspecting and/or replacing this cladding or for waking watches to enable them to stay in their homes; and calls on the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government to set out urgently what steps he intends to take to deal with the current situation which is causing great concern to thousands of people.  </p>

			<p>That this House notes that in 1998 members of the Foreign Affairs, Trade, Defence and International Development Committees met together to scrutinise the Government's annual report on arms exports; further notes that this arrangement has been repeated annually and gradually became more formalised as the Committees on Arms Exports Controls (CAEC); expresses concern that, at a time when arms exports were an issue of major public interest, the CAEC in the last Parliament, as technically comprising four separate Committees, found it difficult to hold a quorate meeting; and calls for the establishment of a Committee on Arms Export Controls as a full non-departmental Select Committee, as was one of the recommendations from the 2017-19 CAEC, with an elected chair, members dedicated to it and adequate staffing so as to enable it to give effective scrutiny to a major cross-departmental issue.</p>
