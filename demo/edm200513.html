			<p>That this House notes that 17 May is the annual International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia and Interphobia to highlight the violence and discrimination that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex communities and other people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities or expressions, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) continue to face; further notes with concern that the covid-19 pandemic is increasing inequalities for many marginalised groups globally, including LGBT+ people particularly in the areas of access to healthcare, housing, employment as well as misuse of emergency powers and increase in hate crime and domestic abuse for those in lockdown; celebrates civil society defending LGBT+ rights around the world, including in the jurisdictions where LGBT+ identities remain criminalised; commends the UK’s role as co-chair of the intergovernmental Equal Rights Coalition which advocates for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people; maintains the importance of the UK’s role in promoting and protecting LGBT+ rights globally; and calls on the Government to continue to advance and uphold the rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sammy Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain’s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as £40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to £5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women’s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled it to work with businesses and trade unions to protect the economy and avoid mass redundancies; appreciates the role aviation workers have played in operating flights, repatriating citizens and delivering essential medical and personal protective equipment supplies; considers it deplorable that whilst IAG is taking UK tax payers’ money, as well as using Spanish government guaranteed loans to purchase an additional airline for the group at a cost of €1.2 Billion, it is serving notice of redundancies to UK employees with</p>
			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to £3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of €10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned with the increasing financial pressures being felt by struggling families as a result of the coronavirus; recognises that energy bills are estimated to increase by an average of £32 a month or almost £400 a year due to increased energy usage during lockdown; understands that the vast majority of people do not change energy suppliers for a variety of reasons and an estimated 16 million homes are overpaying for energy on the standard variable tariff with one of the six biggest energy providers; acknowledges that high energy costs have a serious impact on people’s finances, coming at a time when many face losing their jobs and livelihoods and are facing real financial difficulties on reduced incomes; appreciates that reduced incomes and increased costs will lead many families to borrow to get by, potentially plunging millions of households into further financial difficulty; and calls on the Government to do all it can to support more households to switch to cheaper energy suppliers to help ease those pressures during this time of national crisis.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the aviation industry to the national and regional economies of the UK; acknowledges the aviation industry's efforts to achieve sustainability and specifically its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the Government's overall target for the UK; acknowledges the immense impact of the covid-19 pandemic on aviation and connected sectors including leisure and tourism; understands that there will likely be a lag in the recovery of these sectors when lockdown restrictions are lifted and that this will require continued support from Government; recognises the industry’s need for advance notice of changes to accommodate the long planning horizon for restoring services; notes with concern the announcement of large numbers of redundancies in the sector; is concerned about the impact of the covid-19 crisis on the future of the industry and its ability to achieve its sustainability objectives; notes the importance of Government measures such as the job retention scheme to aviation businesses; and urges the Government and the aviation industry to work together on a solution that provides the necessary support through the crisis, protects jobs and ensures that the industry can achieve sustainability.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the awarding of the contract for the clean-up of radioactive material at Dalgety Bay beach by the Ministry of Defence earlier this year; notes that the beach became contaminated with radioactive particles originating from the instrument panels of military aircraft dumped at the site after WWII; observes that the contamination was first discovered in 1990 during a SEPA survey and that the clean-up operation has experienced repeated delays since the MoD was appointed the Appropriate Person responsible for remediation in 2013; understands that the work is set to include clearing the beach of contaminated material and installing a barrier to prevent other material rising to the surface from the sea bed; believes that the first phase of remediation works is due to commence imminently; pays tribute to numerous local community representatives who have pursued this matter doggedly, including Councillors David Barratt and Alice McGarry, and former hon. Member Roger Mullin, all of whom have worked tirelessly to push the MoD to progress this longstanding project; and urges the UK Government to take every possible step to reduce the risk of any potential delay to the commencement of those works as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House, fully supporting the sport of shooting and the private ownership of firearms within the law, notes the importance to public safety of monitoring the medical health of firearms certificate holders during the lifetime of their certificates; further notes that Government policy, as expressed in Home Office guidance on firearms licensing, asks general practitioners to place a marker on the medical notes of certificate holders so that a doctor treating the certificate holder will know that they own firearms and can make police aware if concerns arise; is therefore most concerned at the number of police constabularies which have instituted practices in breach of Home Office guidance by adopting medical verification of certificate applications without providing for markers to be placed on medical notes; considers this a failure to implement Government policy which falls short in protecting public safety; and calls on the Government to ensure that an effective and efficient system of medical involvement in firearms licensing through the placing of markers on certificate holders medical notes is implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>
