			<p>That this House recognises the ‘no recourse to public funds’ restrictions placed on many forms of leave to remain in the UK are a source of significant financial hardship; appreciates that a great many people have been living, working and contributing economically, socially and culturally to life in the UK while being excluded from accessing any public funds; is concerned that these restrictions, which can be a cause of hardship at the best of times, are pushing people and families into destitution during the coronavirus crisis; acknowledges that people from all backgrounds have found their livelihoods and incomes under threat due to the coronavirus and not all of those affected have been able to access financial assistance through Government coronavirus support schemes; understands that this situation is particularly desperate for those subject to no recourse to public funds restrictions as they are also excluded from the social safety which would provide support such as housing benefit or universal credit; further recognises the work of the Kurdish Development Association, and in particular Shakha Sattar, for their work in highlighting these issues and campaigning for change; believes that it is essential everyone has access to a social safety net as a basic human right; and calls on the UK Government to immediately lift the ‘no recourse to public funds’ restrictions and ensure that everyone who needs support can access it during this crisis and the recovery that follows.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the profound impact covid-19 has had across the globe, affecting health and health services, impacting the global economy, and exacerbating social and economic inequalities; notes however that the world continues to face an ever-growing environmental emergency; believes the pandemic has highlighted the importance of governments working together, and that this global response must be built on to address the climate crisis; welcomes the joint statement to this effect released on World Environment Day by the national science academies of eighteen Commonwealth Nations, including the UK’s Royal Society; echoes the statement’s calls on Commonwealth governments to continue to address the joint challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, and to ensure that global economic recovery from the pandemic is environmentally sustainable across the Commonwealth and globally; and urges the UK government to use the opportunity of COP26 to help coordinate these discussions and support a joint approach to tackling these challenges.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John Nicolson</p>
			<p>That this House calls for the teaching of British colonial history in school curricula across the UK; recognises that much of Britain's wealth was built upon brutal suppression and the embedding of racism and division across the world; that great cities such as Glasgow, Liverpool and Bristol were built upon the investments of the slave trade; that our collective lack of understanding of Britain's role in cultivating notions of race and racial hierarchy misinforms discussions about racism in Britain to this day; and notes that unpicking how and why racial prejudice was constructed would make for a more sophisticated discussion about racism now and would erode the false notion that Britain was ever exclusively “white”.</p>

			<p>That this House notes United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ recent call for a global ceasefire to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19; futher notes that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab endorsed this call for peace; is concerned that little action has been taken by the UK government to make this a reality; laments the fact that there are currently thousands of British forces in at least 35 countries around the world, including 1,000 in Afghanistan and more than 1,000 in the Middle East including in Iraq and Saudi Arabia; is appalled that Britain remains complicit in the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen; recognises that the coronavirus outbreak offers our government a unique opportunity to step away from global conflicts; and calls on the Government to immediately draw up a plan to withdraw British troops from war zones.</p>

			<p>That this House stands in solidarity with the friends, family and community of George Floyd in Minneapolis; recognises that George Floyd is tragically another name on the long list of unarmed Black men that have died in police custody in the United States of America (USA); notes that state-sanctioned racism is not solely an issue in the USA but also one that we experience here in the UK; acknowledges that Black people suffer disproportionately from police use of force, are more likely to receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts, and are over-represented in the prison population; is alarmed that between 1995 and 2015, regardless of the circumstances, no police office was prosecuted over the death of a Black person in custody; believes that Black Lives Matter; supports the Black Lives Matter campaign; calls on the UK Government to challenge institutional racism and address the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.</p>

			<p>That this House calls for a decent and fair pay rise for all workers delivering local authority services; notes that local authority and school staff are working above and beyond the call of duty with the daily risk presented by covid-19; respects workers’ dedication to keep public services running and our country on track: pays tribute to frontline local authority workers who are protecting our communities in a wide range of vital services from caring for the young, vulnerable and elderly to collecting rubbish and from cleaning streets to working in crematoria to ensure dignity for those who have, sadly, fallen victim to this virus; is deeply concerned that those workers continue to be some of the lowest paid in the economy and that many have seen their pay drop in real terms by over 20 per cent after 10 years of austerity and cuts; acknowledges that the current pay offer to local authority staff is inadequate and that the misunderstanding of the annual leave section of the joint union claim is insulting to staff; is further concerned that the lowest paid are being asked to accept a pay rise of little more than £1.82 per day; and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that local authority workers receive the dignity and fairness they deserve.</p>

			<p>That this House notes many students in further and higher education experience financial hardship during the course of their studies and that these difficulties are being exacerbated by the wider economic and social consequences of the coronavirus pandemic; further notes that financial support provided by awards agencies and student loan companies across different parts of the UK is usually provided on a term-time basis only, and that many students would seek to supplement their income with paid employment, especially during summer months; believes that many traditional summer job opportunities for students are unlikely to exist as a result of social distancing and economic restrictions; and urges all Governments across the UK  to work in partnership with each other, student representative bodies and relevant awards agencies and loans companies to ensure that adequate financial support is available to further and higher education students throughout the 2020 calendar year, including access to universal credit or other appropriate benefits, the provision of increased finance to further and higher education institutions to disburse through hardship funds, and access to other appropriate support during these unprecedented times.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the UK Government’s stated position to stick rigidly to its timeline of ending the EU transition period in December 2020; recognises that this significantly increases the risk of a no-deal exit; further recognises that it will be impossible for the vast majority of businesses and communities to prepare for life outside the single market and customs union while coping with the effect of the covid-19 pandemic at the same time; notes that the devolved Governments did not give their consent to the Government’s EU Withdrawal Agreement legislation; concludes that the only realistic and reasonable approach is for the Government to revise its timeline for negotiation; further notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to one or two years; calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the transition period.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>
