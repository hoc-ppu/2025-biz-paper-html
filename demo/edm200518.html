			<p>That this House welcomes the news that the Turing Trust has chosen to adapt a unit in Pentland Industrial Estate in Midlothian to help its work supporting education programmes in Africa; notes that the Turing Trust supports education in sub-Saharan Africa by reusing computers and improving teacher training, providing development skills in the UK to make use of redundant IT equipment provided by big business users, which reduces waste and contributes to an environmentally friendly society; understands that the trust’s work has a significant environmental impact by offsetting 183 tonnes of CO2 emissions from reusing redundant PCs, which is the equivalent of planting 457 trees or offsetting the annual carbon footprint of 19 Scots; and recognises that Alan Turing was a leading figure at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and a brilliant mathematician and code breaker credited with doing much to assist an Allied victory.</p>

			<p>That this House commends Cornbank Primary School pupil Blake Young for using his daily exercise time during lockdown to run at least 2.6 miles a day, amounting to more than the distance of a marathon over the course of a week, to raise money for SIMBA; notes that SIMBA is a charity which supports baby loss at any stage of pregnancy, something that has touched Blake and his family personally; congratulates Blake for raising more than £700 for the charity; and highlights the importance of exercise at this time, as well as the innovative opportunities for fundraising that lockdown presents.</p>

			<p>That this House calls for a decent and fair pay rise for all workers delivering local authority services; notes that local authority and school staff are working above and beyond the call of duty with the daily risk presented by covid-19; respects workers’ dedication to keep public services running and our country on track: pays tribute to frontline local authority workers who are protecting our communities in a wide range of vital services from caring for the young, vulnerable and elderly to collecting rubbish and from cleaning streets to working in crematoria to ensure dignity for those who have, sadly, fallen victim to this virus; is deeply concerned that those workers continue to be some of the lowest paid in the economy and that many have seen their pay drop in real terms by over 20 per cent after 10 years of austerity and cuts; acknowledges that the current pay offer to local authority staff is inadequate and that the misunderstanding of the annual leave section of the joint union claim is insulting to staff; is further concerned that the lowest paid are being asked to accept a pay rise of little more than £1.82 per day; and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that local authority workers receive the dignity and fairness they deserve.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Daisy Cooper</p>
			<p>That this House believes that any variations to lockdown restrictions must include a strategy to test, trace and isolate to prevent a new surge in coronavirus infections; notes that the Government plans to roll out a smartphone app to aid contact tracing; believes that for enough people to use the app for it to be effective, the public will need to have confidence that their personal data is safe, and that the app will work effectively; further believes that participation in the app must be voluntary; and calls on the Government to introduce legislation for a safe trace app to provide clear safeguards for personal data collected through the app and by human contract tracers, to prohibit discrimination against people who do not use the app, and to create significant penalties for the misuse of data.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">David Linden</p>
			<p>That this House notes many students in further and higher education experience financial hardship during the course of their studies and that these difficulties are being exacerbated by the wider economic and social consequences of the coronavirus pandemic; further notes that financial support provided by awards agencies and student loan companies across different parts of the UK is usually provided on a term-time basis only, and that many students would seek to supplement their income with paid employment, especially during summer months; believes that many traditional summer job opportunities for students are unlikely to exist as a result of social distancing and economic restrictions; and urges all Governments across the UK  to work in partnership with each other, student representative bodies and relevant awards agencies and loans companies to ensure that adequate financial support is available to further and higher education students throughout the 2020 calendar year, including access to universal credit or other appropriate benefits, the provision of increased finance to further and higher education institutions to disburse through hardship funds, and access to other appropriate support during these unprecedented times.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Stewart Malcolm McDonald</p>
			<p>That this House notes the deportation and ethnic cleansing of Crimean Tatars carried out between the 18th and 20th of May 1944, in which the Soviet Union forcefully removed over 180,000 Crimean Tatar people from their historic territory to distant areas of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation; honours the memory of those who died during that expulsion, believed to be almost half the entire Tatar population; notes the ban on the return to Crimea lasted until 1989; condemns the current illegal occupation of, and armed aggression against, Crimea by the Russian Federation and the systemic abuse of Tatar rights which has caused many people to flee their homeland; agrees with the joint statement by the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, issued on the 76th anniversary of the Crimean Tatar people deportation, which emphasises the inviolability of sovereignty and territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine; calls upon the Russian Federation to stop violations of international law and to fully implement UN General Assembly resolutions on the human rights situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea; further calls on the Russian Federation to end its occupation of Crimea; and calls on the Government to ensure that no matter what attempts undertaken by the Russian Federation to seek to legitimise its occupation of the peninsula, that Crimea is part of Ukraine.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Blackford</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the UK Government’s stated position to stick rigidly to its timeline of ending the EU transition period in December 2020; recognises that this significantly increases the risk of a no-deal exit; further recognises that it will be impossible for the vast majority of businesses and communities to prepare for life outside the single market and customs union while coping with the effect of the covid-19 pandemic at the same time; notes that the devolved Governments did not give their consent to the Government’s EU Withdrawal Agreement legislation; concludes that the only realistic and reasonable approach is for the Government to revise its timeline for negotiation; further notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to one or two years; calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the transition period.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Apsana Begum</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the additional stress and anxiety among the older population during the covid-19 outbreak; notes that a significant contributory factor to this is an increase in the financial burden on older people during the pandemic; that such costs include paying for deliveries of groceries, medicines and other essential supplies, use of private hire taxis instead of public transport, telephone and internet costs and home heating; and calls on the Government to acknowledge that financial burden and to implement, as a matter of urgency, a covid-19 pensioner support payment throughout the UK to help meet those financial pressures,.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the ongoing challenges faced by Merchant Navy seafarers who are unable to return home due to global covid-19 pandemic restrictions; understands that as a result of port and air route bans for individual travellers there are an estimated 2,000 UK mariners that have been unable to return home to their families, while relief crews cannot be brought in which has resulted in some seafarers being trapped on board their ships for over 120 days; recognises that this extended period of time stranded onboard with no apparent end date is having a significant effect on the physical and mental wellbeing of seafarers, as well as a detrimental impact on their families; acknowledges that merchant shipping handles around 95 per cent of the UK’s internationally traded goods and is essential to the UK’s economy; is concerned that seafarers are the UK’s forgotten key workers during this pandemic, delivering supplies and keeping our shelves stocked; urges the Government to sign up to the International Maritime Organisation’s new plan to ensure crew changeovers can resume; and calls on the Government to do all it can to prioritise the safe return of seafarers to their families and loved ones.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to £5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women’s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that seafarers and dockers are classed by the Government as key workers; pays tribute to the vital role they have played in keeping the UK moving and connected during the Coronavirus crisis; is concerned by the findings of the RMT trade union survey of seafarers and port workers that employers are seeking to erode terms and conditions of employment in 65 per cent of cases, whilst  33 per cent of seafarers have not been supplied with personal protective equipment and 39 per cent of maritime workers believe that employers are putting safety before profit; further notes that some ferry companies have abandoned sick pay schemes, are making redundancies and want to permanently replace UK Ratings with non-UK crews paid below the National Minimum Wage; notes that these attacks on seafarers are taking place despite the UK taxpayer supporting 80 per cent of the wages of over 2,100 maritime workers, mainly seafarers and dockers furloughed by P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Line; agrees with the RMT that all taxpayer support given to employers during and after the pandemic should be linked to adequate safety protection and increased employment and training for UK Ratings and port workers in the long term; and also urges the Government to work with the RMT to set a new deal for the maritime industry which ends the UK’s reliance on low cost crewing on shipping routes from UK ports and to re-build maritime employment, infrastructure and skills, particularly in port towns and cities.</p>
