			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain’s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as £40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the adverse effect the covid–19 pandemic has on social isolation generally and new mothers on maternity leave in particular; highlights the importance of social interaction and building bonds within extended family circles and wider society both for the babies development and mothers wellbeing; and acknowledges that this is impossible during lockdown restrictions, that a Parliamentary Petition calling for a three month extension to maternity leave has significantly passed the threshold for debate but given no petition debates are occurring at present calls on the Government to consider this proposal positively.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the high number of tenants who have lost income during the coronavirus crisis; further concerned about the number of tenants who are in rent arrears and are at risk of eviction as soon as the temporary freeze on evictions is lifted; notes that this crisis comes at a time when our housing system already prioritises the private profits of landlords over the rights of tenants; is concerned about reports of tenants being pressured into paying rent when that leaves them without enough money for food or other essentials; commends the work of tenant and community unions including ACORN, Living Rent and the London Renters Union in organising to protect communities during this crisis; calls on the Government to suspend rent immediately for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis, cancel rent arrears accrued during the crisis and protect renters from eviction so that no one loses their home while they are trying to cope with Coronavirus and its aftermath.</p>

			<p>That this House calls for a decent and fair pay rise for all workers delivering local authority services; notes that local authority and school staff are working above and beyond the call of duty with the daily risk presented by covid-19; respects workers’ dedication to keep public services running and our country on track: pays tribute to frontline local authority workers who are protecting our communities in a wide range of vital services from caring for the young, vulnerable and elderly to collecting rubbish and from cleaning streets to working in crematoria to ensure dignity for those who have, sadly, fallen victim to this virus; is deeply concerned that those workers continue to be some of the lowest paid in the economy and that many have seen their pay drop in real terms by over 20 per cent after 10 years of austerity and cuts; acknowledges that the current pay offer to local authority staff is inadequate and that the misunderstanding of the annual leave section of the joint union claim is insulting to staff; is further concerned that the lowest paid are being asked to accept a pay rise of little more than £1.82 per day; and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that local authority workers receive the dignity and fairness they deserve.</p>
