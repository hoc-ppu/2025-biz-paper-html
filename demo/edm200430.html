			<p>That this House notes that one of the World Health Organisation's six preconditions for lifting lockdowns includes the capacity to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact; is deeply concerned that this precondition is not reflected in the Government’s five tests for exiting lockdown and believes that this omission risks putting more lives in jeopardy; believes that while appropriately protected phone apps will have an important role to play, their use will need to be coupled with human-led contact tracing to be effective; further believes that the best way to prevent further covid-19 outbreaks and new lockdowns is to put in place a nationwide system of testing, identifying infected individuals, tracing their contacts, and imposing supported quarantine requirements; therefore urges the Government to widen its criteria for exiting lockdown to include the WHO recommendations on testing, tracing and isolating contacts; calls on the Government to urgently put in place the infrastructure for these community shields via a comprehensive, targeted system to report, isolate, test, monitor and contract trace, thereby creating a network of community-based protection schemes to respond quickly to any re-emergence of covid-19 once the current lockdown is lifted; and recommends that this action should be coordinated by Public Health England’s regional Outbreak Management Teams and the appropriate devolved Public Health bodies, working in coordination with GPs, local authority public health teams, and suitably experienced and trained volunteers.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the tourism sector to the UK economy and that tourism-related businesses lie at the heart of many local communities; notes that this sector has been disproportionally impacted by the covid-19 epidemic; is concerned by reports that in areas of the UK reliant on hospitality and tourism, up to 35 per cent of jobs are permanently at risk because of the pandemic, and that Visit Britain estimates that covid-19 will cost the tourism industry around £15 billion in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK; further notes that a reduced rate of VAT for tourism has long been recommended by three select committees and attracted cross-party support; highlights that the UK is one of only three European countries to have never taken advantage of the EU rules allowing a reduced VAT rate on tourism and that Germany has now cut VAT to 7 per cent to help specific sectors of the economy; calls on the Government to reduce tourism VAT to 5 per cent to help this sector recover from the pandemic, at the same time as strengthening the wider economy, supporting job creation and generating investment in local businesses.</p>

			<p>This House notes the increase in use of artificial intelligence and automated-decision-making to recruit, manage and pay workers remotely through the coronavirus pandemic; recognises that learning from past patterns of behaviour to inform decisions about the future increases the risk of deepening inequality for people and groups who are already experiencing disadvantage; further notes that fair access to, and terms of, work is critical at a time when 15 per cent of the workforce have already lost their jobs and over 2 million people are claiming universal credit; expresses concern that the auditing tools most commonly used to assess the risk of discrimination are importing legal standards from the United States which do not reflect the purpose or requirements of the Equality Act 2010; recognises new research from the Institute for the Future of Work which reveals significant limitations in exiting approaches to assessing the impacts of automated systems on equality; and calls on the Government to develop and enforce high industry standards to promote good governance and compliance of the Equality Act, to require regular Equality Impact Assessments as proposed by the Institute for the Future of Work and to review the application and enforcement of the Equality Act to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>

Nicol, A.Tong, H. Tong, Rushtong &amp; King (sub) and that their team, Association Torelló, would go on to become the current club CD Borgonyá; notes that the current club continue to honour their Scots heritage with a small saltire on their black and white jerseys, the only two colours in which the factory thread was dyed, and the same kit design that Paisley team St Mirren play in; acknowledges that around 100 people attended the match, which resulted in a victory for the Barcelona select side; celebrates the Scottish influence on Catalan, Spanish, and wider global footballing history; and wishes CD Borgonyá the best of luck when football matches are resumed.</p>

			<p>That this House warmly congratulates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq, as it lifts the lockdown, for its concerted measures that have so far contained the spread of coronavirus in a population of about 6 million people to 347 cases and four deaths; notes that the KRG carries 70 per cent of the burden of the nearly $1 billion annual cost for providing basic services to over a million internally displaced people and refugees from Syria, many in camps, and who account for one fifth of the population; further recognises that sharp decreases in oil prices present grave difficulties given that Kurdistan and Iraq rely so heavily on oil revenues; hopes that the Iraqi government and the KRG can soon reach a long-term agreement on oil and revenue-sharing; and urges the caretaker government in Baghdad not to proceed with plans to cut federal subventions to the Kurdistan Region.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses its gratitude for the hard work of local authorities in helping to ensure that vulnerable groups are protected during the covid-19 pandemic; recognises the vital role that local authorities are playing in the co-ordination and running of local support groups that distribute food and medication and identify vulnerable people within the community; and calls on the Government to provide the necessary financial support and urgently clarify how and when that support will be distributed.</p>
