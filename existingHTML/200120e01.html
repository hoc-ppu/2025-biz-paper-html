			<p>That this House congratulates those who took part in the march of 11 January in Glasgow in support of Scottish Independence; commends the resolute determination of the marchers who braved horrendous weather to make their voices heard; understands that it was estimated that tens of thousands of people participated in the march; respects that these citizens were asserting the nation of Scotland's right to decide to choose its own future; recognises that this follows on from the election of more than 80 per cent of Scotland's MPs standing on a manifesto calling for Scotland's future to be in Scotland's hands; understands that for the first time in history Members elected from the two principal countries within the UK have different constitutional mandates for their respective countries; is mindful of the fact that any denial of the democratic will of the people of Scotland in seeking to determine their own future contradicts principles of equality and ignores the Claim of Right for Scotland, that the people of Scotland have the sovereign right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs; appreciates that this Right is well established and was most recently endorsed by the House of Commons in July 2018; and asserts that all attempts to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people to choose their own future are unsustainable.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Holly Lynch</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that the Mental Health Act will be reformed; agrees that current legislation is out of step with a modern mental healthcare system and that people must have a service that affords them the dignity and respect that they deserve; further notes that the announcement made no mention of the urgent needs of children; contends that unless their needs are embedded into a new Mental Health Act as a central priority such legislation will be fundamentally flawed; calls on the Government to guarantee that new mental health legislation will focus on children&#8217;s needs and protect them, ensure that services are provided by a properly qualified workforce, reflect policies that are informed by the best available evidence; and further calls on the Government to focus on the needs of parents and carers and guarantee to bring forward such legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

Members to watch La Dolce Vita, an iconic love letter to his adopted city of Rome; and notes that Fellini&#8217;s directorial breadth went further to include surrealist and semi-autobiographical masterpieces including 8&#189; and Roma which unpicked the social, religious and sexual mores of the era in which Italy redefined itself as an open and vibrant democracy at the heart of European culture.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the positive interventions from many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions; welcomes the equalisation of retirement ages between women and men; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory employment and pension laws; recognises that this included being excluded from some pensions schemes; recognises that this had the negative effect for them of losing the opportunity to have the same level of pension as their partner or spouse; further recognises that this has had the consequence of women in this position never being able to have equal pensions to men; further notes that this has negatively and profoundly impacted on them including increased poverty, deteriorating health and homelessness; notes that at least 3.8 million women have been impacted by the loss of their pensions from the age of 60 in three separate age hikes; and calls on the Government to enact a temporary special measure as permitted by international law to provide restitution to women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions from the age of 60 because of the impact of the rise in retirement age.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the death sentence imposed on Mr Junaid Hafeez, a lecturer at Bahauddin Zakariya University, Pakistan; notes that his first defence lawyer was assassinated by extremists, his second lawyer was intimidated into dropping his case, and the third lawyer has received many such threats; further notes that the trial proceedings are unsafe, unsatisfactory and contrary to Pakistan's constitutional guarantees of due process and fair trial; expresses alarm that Mr Hafeez has been in solitary confinement for six years after he was attacked by other prisoners in the jail; recognises that this lengthy confinement is contrary to the provisions of Article 7 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights to which Pakistan is a signatory; and appeals to the Supreme Court of Pakistan to expedite the case by taking Suo Moto action and to review the case on an urgent basis.</p>

			<p>This House notes that strategic rail infrastructure is critical to the long-term success of the UK and all of its parts; believes after decades of under-investment in strategic rail infrastructure that HS2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and Midlands Engine Rail delivered in full represent a once in a generation chance to transform connectivity, attract investment, boost skills and opportunity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands and will benefit the rest of the UK; further believes that transforming rail capacity and connectivity in the North and Midlands will create economic growth, improve productivity, boost jobs and skills, increase prosperity and support a transition to a low-carbon economy; and calls on the Government to deliver HS2 in full and recognise this once in a generation opportunity to transform rail capacity and connectivity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around &#163;10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to &#163;10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid &#163;728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of &#163;9.30 per hour (&#163;10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the 77 per cent increase in the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation in England to 84,740 since 2010, including 126,020 children, with a further 82,000 children sofa surfing according to the Children&#8217;s Commissioner; is concerned that according to Crisis a further 3.74 million people would rather have a home of their own; condemns the increasing number of homeless individuals dying, including 726 in 2018 alone; recognises that a large proportion of homelessness is the result of cuts to housing benefit; notes that the increase in evictions is driven by insecure tenancies and exacerbated by court action, that temporary accommodation for some is lasting over ten years, and that the impact on the health and well-being of homeless people and their children can be very severe; and calls on the Government to support the Elimination of Homelessness Bill, urgently take steps to increase housing and council tax benefit as well as universal credit, and adequately fund local authorities to ensure that no property remains empty or unused for more than six months.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the growing body of evidence, including research reports by Doctors of the World, Maternity Action and the British Medical Association, that the NHS England overseas visitors charging regime is deterring vulnerable migrant women living in the UK from seeking essential maternity care; is further concerned that the MBRRACE-UK report, Saving Lives, Improving Mothers&#8217; Care 2019, published on 13 December 2019, links the charging regime and a possible fear of being charged to the deaths of three women who delayed seeking critical antenatal care in 2015-17; notes that the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Midwives have all urged ministers to suspend the charging regime pending a full independent review of its impact on individual and public health; further notes that less than 40 per cent of the total sum of charges levied in England in recent years has actually been recovered by the NHS; agrees with the stated view of the Royal College of Midwives that the Government has a duty to give the NHS the resources it needs and should not be using NHS clinicians to patrol our borders; and urges the Government to respond positively to Maternity Action&#8217;s call, supported by the Royal College of Midwives, for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care.</p>
