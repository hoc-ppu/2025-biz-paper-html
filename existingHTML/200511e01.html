			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that many supply teachers are still facing significant anxiety due to a lack of clarity from the Government with regards to furlough during the covid-19 outbreak; notes that with schools set to reopen in a phased manner many supply teachers will rely on the welfare system for the foreseeable future; believes that the Government needs to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that supply teachers are provided with the financial relief they need; calls on the Government to ensure that all supply teachers, regardless of how they are employed, receive 80 per cent of their true average earnings when furloughed; and further calls on the Government to create a dedicated separate webpage for supply teachers to provide them with guidance and advice in one place, work with supply agencies and schools to clearly communicate responsibilities and reassure schools wanting to keep supply teachers that funding will be available for them to do so.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned with the increasing financial pressures being felt by struggling families as a result of the coronavirus; recognises that energy bills are estimated to increase by an average of &#163;32 a month or almost &#163;400 a year due to increased energy usage during lockdown; understands that the vast majority of people do not change energy suppliers for a variety of reasons and an estimated 16 million homes are overpaying for energy on the standard variable tariff with one of the six biggest energy providers; acknowledges that high energy costs have a serious impact on people&#8217;s finances, coming at a time when many face losing their jobs and livelihoods and are facing real financial difficulties on reduced incomes; appreciates that reduced incomes and increased costs will lead many families to borrow to get by, potentially plunging millions of households into further financial difficulty; and calls on the Government to do all it can to support more households to switch to cheaper energy suppliers to help ease those pressures during this time of national crisis.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Catherine McKinnell</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Graham Brady</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the aviation industry to the national and regional economies of the UK; acknowledges the aviation industry's efforts to achieve sustainability and specifically its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the Government's overall target for the UK; acknowledges the immense impact of the covid-19 pandemic on aviation and connected sectors including leisure and tourism; understands that there will likely be a lag in the recovery of these sectors when lockdown restrictions are lifted and that this will require continued support from Government; recognises the industry&#8217;s need for advance notice of changes to accommodate the long planning horizon for restoring services; notes with concern the announcement of large numbers of redundancies in the sector; is concerned about the impact of the covid-19 crisis on the future of the industry and its ability to achieve its sustainability objectives; notes the importance of Government measures such as the job retention scheme to aviation businesses; and urges the Government and the aviation industry to work together on a solution that provides the necessary support through the crisis, protects jobs and ensures that the industry can achieve sustainability.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the awarding of the contract for the clean-up of radioactive material at Dalgety Bay beach by the Ministry of Defence earlier this year; notes that the beach became contaminated with radioactive particles originating from the instrument panels of military aircraft dumped at the site after WWII; observes that the contamination was first discovered in 1990 during a SEPA survey and that the clean-up operation has experienced repeated delays since the MoD was appointed the Appropriate Person responsible for remediation in 2013; understands that the work is set to include clearing the beach of contaminated material and installing a barrier to prevent other material rising to the surface from the sea bed; believes that the first phase of remediation works is due to commence imminently; pays tribute to numerous local community representatives who have pursued this matter doggedly, including Councillors David Barratt and Alice McGarry, and former hon. Member Roger Mullin, all of whom have worked tirelessly to push the MoD to progress this longstanding project; and urges the UK Government to take every possible step to reduce the risk of any potential delay to the commencement of those works as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Andrew Selous</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Philippa Whitford</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the plans of the new Israeli coalition government to annex part of the occupied West Bank; further notes that Israeli legislation can progress from 1 July 2020 to carry out such an annexation; highlights that any such annexation of territory occupied in 1967 is a breach of international law which rejects any acquisition of territory through force and that it would be a major threat to peace; notes that when Russia illegally annexed the Crimea in 2014, the UK joined EU partners in imposing sanctions on that country; calls on the Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that such a step will have severe consequences for the UK-Israel relationship; and further calls on the Government to introduce sanctions similar to those impose on Russia in the event that an annexation of occupied territory takes place.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">385</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>VAT on tourism</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Tracey Crouch</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the tourism sector to the UK economy and that tourism-related businesses lie at the heart of many local communities; notes that this sector has been disproportionally impacted by the covid-19 epidemic; is concerned by reports that in areas of the UK reliant on hospitality and tourism, up to 35 per cent of jobs are permanently at risk because of the pandemic, and that Visit Britain estimates that covid-19 will cost the tourism industry around &#163;15 billion in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK; further notes that a reduced rate of VAT for tourism has long been recommended by three select committees and attracted cross-party support; highlights that the UK is one of only three European countries to have never taken advantage of the EU rules allowing a reduced VAT rate on tourism and that Germany has now cut VAT to 7 per cent to help specific sectors of the economy; calls on the Government to reduce tourism VAT to 5 per cent to help this sector recover from the pandemic, at the same time as strengthening the wider economy, supporting job creation and generating investment in local businesses.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">386</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>SME and pub eligibility for coronavirus grant funds</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</p>
			<p>That this House notes that any SME occupying premises with a rateable value of more than &#163;51,000 is excluded from the Small Business Grants Fund (SBGF) and Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund (RHLGF); believes that this criteria is unfair to a wide range of SMEs, including those for whom landlords are the ratepayers and those who collectively occupy premises over the rateable value threshold with a number of other business; further notes that, according to the British Beer and Pub Association, there are 10,000 pubs still without any grant support because they are above the &#163;51,000 rateable value threshold; and therefore calls on the Government to remove the rateable value criteria and instead open up the SRGF and the RHLGF to all SMEs and pubs.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">389</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	27/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	18</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that the details do not reflect the reality of self-employment in the UK; notes that the scheme calculates support based on three years of tax returns and therefore financially penalises those who have worked part time or not at all during that period because of caring responsibilities or maternity/paternity leave, as well as new starters and the recently self-employed; further notes that those who combine PAYE work with being self-employed are not eligible for a proportionate amount of support from the SEISS as well as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; notes that neither profit invested back into the development of self-employed businesses or paid as dividends to directors of small limited companies is counted as income for the purposes of the SEISS and that this is leaving many self-employed people without access to a liveable income; and therefore urges the Government to review the details of the SEISS to correct these anomalies and ensure that the scheme reflects the needs of the more than five million self-employed people in the UK.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Joanna Cherry</span></p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the crisis facing the oil and gas sector as a result of covid-19; notes that the price of oil is now just over $20 per barrel compared with over $70 per barrel this time last year; fears that this low price of oil could see upwards of 3,500 workers displaced by September 2020; expresses solidarity with drilling sector workers who have been told there will not be any upturn in activity until 2022; is distressed to hear Subsea sector contracts are being ended and vessels tied up; notes the effect that this will have on Government energy strategy and the wider economy; and calls on the Government to intervene to save the sector, protect jobs and ensure a just transition to a carbon neutral state.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the updated Construction Leadership Council guidance version three is considerably weaker than version two; is particularly troubled by the relaxation of measures relating to social distancing; is worried about the implications of this on the health and safety of construction workers and the wider public; urges contractors and clients to enforce on site social distancing; further urges contractors and clients to prove they are taking their moral duty to construction workers seriously by staggering site opening times to allow workers to social distance by avoiding overcrowded public transport; understands the importance of key workers not only feeling safe in the workplace but from when they leave their home to start work to when they return home after finishing work; and supports the withdrawal of the Construction Leadership Council guidance and the implementation of tougher procedures, which are strictly enforced.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the emerging trend of criminals seeking to exploit coronavirus with a new range of scams; welcomes the free scam alerts set up by Which?; urges people to forward any suspicious emails to the National Cyber Security Centre, and to highlight any online scams of which they become aware to the authorities so they can be removed; is concerned that scammers are using any means available, including emails, text messages, phone calls and even doorstep visits to perpetrate fraud; understands that scammers are taking advantage of the fact we are increasingly interacting online, with the UK&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre taking down more than 2,000 online coronavirus scams last month, including 471 fake online shops, 555 malicious content websites and&#160;200 phishing sites seeking to obtain personal information such as passwords and card details; recognises some common scams have recently developed including the selling of fake coronavirus tests, fake vaccines and cures, bogus messages from HMRC regarding tax refunds and even demands that people pay fines for breaking lockdown rules; acknowledges that scam emails and other correspondence purporting to be from legitimate sources are often sophisticated and appear completely authentic; understands that people are safer if they only buy from trusted and legitimate retailers, and are extremely vigilant regarding any unsolicited contact at this time; and affirms that much like the coronavirus pandemic, it is only by coming together to protect one another that ruthless criminals seeking to profit from this health crisis will be defeated.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that seafarers and dockers are classed by the Government as key workers; pays tribute to the vital role they have played in keeping the UK moving and connected during the Coronavirus crisis; is concerned by the findings of the RMT trade union survey of seafarers and port workers that employers are seeking to erode terms and conditions of employment in 65 per cent of cases, whilst  33 per cent of seafarers have not been supplied with personal protective equipment and 39 per cent of maritime workers believe that employers are putting safety before profit; further notes that some ferry companies have abandoned sick pay schemes, are making redundancies and want to permanently replace UK Ratings with non-UK crews paid below the National Minimum Wage; notes that these attacks on seafarers are taking place despite the UK taxpayer supporting 80 per cent of the wages of over 2,100 maritime workers, mainly seafarers and dockers furloughed by P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Line; agrees with the RMT that all taxpayer support given to employers during and after the pandemic should be linked to adequate safety protection and increased employment and training for UK Ratings and port workers in the long term; and also urges the Government to work with the RMT to set a new deal for the maritime industry which ends the UK&#8217;s reliance on low cost crewing on shipping routes from UK ports and to re-build maritime employment, infrastructure and skills, particularly in port towns and cities.</p>
