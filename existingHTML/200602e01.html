			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carla Lockhart</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Fiona Bruce</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that over two months have passed since the President of the Houthi Supreme Political Council in Yemen ordered the release of six Baha&#8217;is, who have been in long term detention in Sana&#8217;a; further notes that this includes Mr Hamed bin Haydara who was under sentence of death and that President al-Mashat ordered his pardon on 25 March; observes that all six Baha&#8217;is are still imprisoned, and that reports confirm that other detainees in their prison facility have contracted covid-19; and urges the Government to make fresh and urgent appeals to the Houthi authorities to expedite the President&#8217;s orders for release of these six prisoners of conscience.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	2/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House notes the need for Government action to support economic renewal as covid-19 restrictions are lifted; believes that this recovery must be a green recovery, designed to deliver the urgent objectives of restoring wildlife and the natural environment on land and at sea, averting dangerous climate change, minimising the UK&#8217;s global environmental footprint, and reversing inequality; considers that strong environmental laws are necessary for public health and a resilient economy, and to ensure more people benefit from the joys of nature that many have experienced or longed for in lockdown; further notes that green projects create more jobs, deliver higher short-term returns, and lead to increased long-term cost savings according to a recent Oxford study among others; believes that restoring the environment requires close collaboration with civil society organisations; calls on the Government to pursue an green economic recovery strategy that gives top priority to the health and wellbeing of people and nature; and further calls on the Government to avoid all measures that contribute to environmental harm and instead to invest in nature-friendly farming, large-scale green infrastructure projects including habitat restoration and creation, improved and equitable access to high-quality greenspace, a regenerative circular zero-waste economy that reduces resource use and addresses over-consumption, and a decisive shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy alongside nature-based solutions to climate change.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that the recently established National Commission for Minorities Rights by the Government of Pakistan does not fulfil the Supreme Court of Pakistan&#8217;s order of June 2014 to set up a Minorities Rights Council and so ensure that the religious minorities&#8217; rights are guaranteed and protected in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan; notes the new mechanism is not an independent or autonomous body, legislatively enshrined or set up in accordance with the Principles Relating to the Status of National Institutions, the Paris Principles; further notes the inclusion of civil servants as official members at the exclusion of minority representation, including the representatives of the Ahmadi community; and appeals to the Government and the Supreme Court of Pakistan to consider the National Minorities Council proposal of Dr Shoaib Suddle, of the One-Man Commission, which was set up by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to carry out its order of June 2014.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that many workers earning the minimum wage are currently only receiving 80 per cent of their minimum wage salary under the Government&#8217;s furlough scheme; is concerned that workers are being expected to live on less than the state-declared minimum wage especially given that rents, bills and food prices have not fallen; is concerned that in the House on 12 May 2020, following a question calling for the introduction of a minimum wage floor to the furlough scheme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer responding by suggesting that workers could seek additional employment which for many is not possible during the covid-19 crisis; notes that women and Black, Asian and minority ethnic workers are more likely to be in lower-paid work; calls on the Government to put in place guarantees to ensure that no furloughed worker is forced to live on less than 100 per cent of the national minimum wage.</p>
