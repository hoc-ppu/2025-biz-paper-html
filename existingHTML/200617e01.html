			<p class="MotionSponsor">Munira Wilson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p>That this House declares that children must be at the heart of the government strategy as lockdown eases; notes that research has shown that home-schooling has been inconsistent across the country during lockdown, with disadvantaged children faring particularly poorly; further notes that the best place for students is in the classroom, as schools provide consistency, social interaction, stimulating learning environments and promote good health and wellbeing being; urges the Government to work together with head teachers, parent bodies, unions and local authorities to urgently devise and publish a plan to safely resume education in September so that children can return to school if the circumstances allow it; and also urges the Government to consider as part of this plan increasing capacity for physical learning, recruiting extra teachers to cope with demand, ensuring all children can learn online who currently do not have access and measures that reduce the widening disadvantage gap.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Girvan</p>
			<p>That this House notes the unprecedented downturn in on-street retail shopping due to Covid-19, calls upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to radically reduce VAT rates for items purchased in store, which would offer much needed assistance to high street retailing in the face of the substantial increase in online shopping which has occurred since March 2020.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the Government's decision to spend &#163;900,000 on painting the RAF Voyager used for Ministerial travel, red, white and blue at a time of national crisis; believes there is no evidence to suggest this will either boost international trade or improve diplomatic links; further suspects that this is nothing more than a vanity project; notes that during his time as Mayor of London, the current Prime Minister lavished taxpayers&#8217; money on similar projects such as the failed Garden Bridge and the doomed Thames Estuary airport; and suggests that a better use of almost &#163;1 million would be to purchase either 180,000 doses of dexamethasone, 60,000 school meal vouchers or 95,000 surgical masks for NHS and social care workers.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the acute difficulties facing business owners throughout the covid-19 outbreak, particularly self-employed people and directors of small limited companies; understands that the Government's financial packages have left behind people who have been left ineligible for any form of Government support; further notes that many self-employed directors of limited companies operated their businesses in this way following incentives from successive Governments by means of tax arrangements that made it easier to establish a limited company and expresses its deep regret that the Government has left these workers and business owners stranded and unable to access financial support through either the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme or the Self Employed Income Support Scheme; considers the availability of universal credit to be insufficient to allow people to both live and protect their businesses; and backs the calls from campaign group Excluded, which estimates that some three million workers have been excluded from Government support to date, to end disparities in Government covid-19 support packages that are currently excluding millions of people across the UK, putting livelihoods and businesses at risk.</p>
