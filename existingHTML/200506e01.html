			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Alistair Carmichael</p>
			<p>That this House commends Clydesdale Bank for cancelling all planned branch closures until further notice; notes that TSB Bank has ignored attempts to discuss, and is committed to continuing with, closing its branch in Tain; acknowledges that bank branches are indispensable in cash-based economies; further acknowledges that bank branch closures cut off communities from accessing cash; further notes that the Government&#8217;s suggested solution to use online banking is inappropriate due to poor broadband infrastructure in the Highlands; and calls on the Government to intervene and prevent TSB Bank and other banks from making bank branch closures until further notice.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mrs Emma Lewell-Buck</p>
			<p>That this House notes that seafarers and dockers are classed by the Government as key workers; pays tribute to the vital role they have played in keeping the UK moving and connected during the Coronavirus crisis; is concerned by the findings of the RMT trade union survey of seafarers and port workers that employers are seeking to erode terms and conditions of employment in 65 per cent of cases, whilst  33 per cent of seafarers have not been supplied with personal protective equipment and 39 per cent of maritime workers believe that employers are putting safety before profit; further notes that some ferry companies have abandoned sick pay schemes, are making redundancies and want to permanently replace UK Ratings with non-UK crews paid below the National Minimum Wage; notes that these attacks on seafarers are taking place despite the UK taxpayer supporting 80 per cent of the wages of over 2,100 maritime workers, mainly seafarers and dockers furloughed by P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Line; agrees with the RMT that all taxpayer support given to employers during and after the pandemic should be linked to adequate safety protection and increased employment and training for UK Ratings and port workers in the long term; and also urges the Government to work with the RMT to set a new deal for the maritime industry which ends the UK&#8217;s reliance on low cost crewing on shipping routes from UK ports and to re-build maritime employment, infrastructure and skills, particularly in port towns and cities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Allan Dorans</p>
			<p>That this House commends the dedication and outstanding work of Voluntary Action South Ayrshire supported by South Ayrshire Council, South Ayrshire Health and Social Care partnership, and third party voluntary organisations across South Ayrshire; notes that it is evolving to incorporate new volunteers and re-assigned employees within a short timescale; further the notes the setting up of the South Ayrshire Lifeline call centre; recognises the provision of additional key services at short notice including delivery of food parcels, prescriptions; PPE to voluntary carers, provisions of a telephone befriending service connecting with self-isolating and elderly constituents, free hearing aid battery supply, and sensory support for hearing or sight impaired constituents; and finally commends the exemplary support given to local organisations during this unprecedented period.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the life and work of Denis Goldberg, anti-apartheid campaigner, a hero of the South Africa liberation struggle, sentenced alongside Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia trial, imprisoned for 22 years, founder of the Community Heart Charity, frequent visitor to Scotland and the UK, Patron of the Nelson Mandela Scottish Memorial Foundation, and Patron of the Kronendal Music Academy who passed away on the 29 April 2020; sends condolences to his family at this sad time; admires the way he continued the anti-apartheid and liberation struggle while in prison, separated from Mandela and his other comrades on Robben Island and incarcerated in Pretoria Central prison as he was white; his continued tireless work for the future of all South Africa&#8217;s people thereafter; recognises his devotion to his last great project, the House of Hope in his community of Hout Bay, near Cape Town, which is to be a centre for the arts and community organisations as well as housing his own extensive collection of African Art; celebrates his life, and notes that he was respected, valued and admired by everyone who worked with him and who experienced the pride and passion he had for his work for a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic South Africa; and equality and justice throughout the world.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Alistair Carmichael</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House believes that the dual impact of low oil prices and covid-19 could lead to the collapse of the North Sea oil and gas industry; notes the Offshore Co-ordinating Group (OCG) of trade unions&#8217; estimate that 3,500 jobs in the supply chain are at immediate risk, with over 1,000 redundancy notices in the drilling sector alone; further notes the employers&#8217; estimate that 30,000 industry jobs could be lost by autumn 2021; notes that oil and gas meets over 75 per cent of the UK&#8217;s primary energy needs and that imports increase carbon emissions; welcomes the formation of the Pandemic Steering Group including employers, regulators and OCG unions; agrees with the view that furlough is a welcome but temporary measure; notes that oil and gas reserves under the North Sea are publicly owned; believes that the state should be the licensee for exploiting oil and gas resources under the UK Continental Shelf; further believes that a Just Transition to net zero carbon is impossible if domestic oil and gas reserves are shut down before 2050; and calls on the Government to prioritise the formation of a task force including OCG trade unions, employers and the Scottish Government to protect jobs and skills, production, investment, decommissioning and tax revenue from this strategically vital industry.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">452</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Protecting bus workers during the covid-19 outbreak</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	6/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	2</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p>That this House commends the UK's front-line bus workers, many of whom have continued to work during the covid-19 outbreak in order to provide transport for other key workers; regrets that tragically, across the UK, a number of bus workers have died from covid-19; is concerned by the findings of a recent survey of bus workers by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union which shows that over 20 per cent of bus workers had been issued no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by their employer, only half had a protective screen fitted in their driving cab and three quarters of bus workers have no access to washing facilities at work; further notes that unlike the rail sector, there is no national coronavirus forum to deal with those issues in the bus sector; recommends that emergency funding for bus operators should be dependent on the compulsory implementation of safety measures to provide all bus workers with sufficient PPE and testing for all those people who exhibit symptoms of covid-19, enforce social distancing measures on all buses, and allow cashless travel; and calls on the Government to work with the transport unions to ensure that all bus workers are protected.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the tremendous effort of the Fife Voluntary Action Helping Hand service in supporting communities in response to the covid-19 outbreak, working to match volunteers to existing community and resilience groups or to individual tasks; thanks the 1800 members of the public who have come forward to volunteer to assist with a range of emergency responses throughout Fife, from telephone befriending to food and medical deliveries; pays tribute to all of the organisations that have been involved throughout the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, including Fife Council, Kirkcaldy Foodbank, Benarty Emergency Response Team, Benarty Foodbank, Lochgelly Beat Corona Group, and Burntisland Action Group; recognises the importance of local food projects, including Max&#8217;s Meals and Community Fridge in Cowdenbeath, Linktown Tenants and Residents Association, Linton Lane Centre and Hug A Mug Coffee Shop who have been delivering food to people shielding, and EATS Rosyth who have expanded to new areas including Aberdour and Dalgety Bay; credits the efforts to work with over 80 pharmacies across the region, with volunteer drivers uplifting and delivering prescriptions to people most at risk due to Coronavirus; and congratulates Fife Voluntary Action on the success of its crowdfunder, which has raised more than &#163;45,000 to pay for essential items such as food, gas or electricity for the most vulnerable.</p>
			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>
			<p>Below are EDMs tabled in the last two weeks to which names have been added. Only the first 6 names and any new names are included.</p>
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">373</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Rojava and covid-19</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	23/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	9</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neil Gray</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Amy Callaghan</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that the North East Syria Autonomous Region (AANES) also known as Rojava is providing sanctuary to 650,000 refugees and IDPs who have fled the attacks of ISIS and the Turkish Government; further notes that the refugees come from diverse ethnicities and religions; further notes that the camps are vastly overcrowded and unhygienic; is aware that AANES also accommodates over 5,000 ISIS captives on behalf of many different countries including the UK; is concerned that Al Hol camp, which houses many ISIS women and their children is a particular breeding ground for covid-19, with ISIS women propagating the message that only infidels and non-muslims are at risk of contracting the virus; is further concerned that many of them are affected by a whole range of underlying health issues, from malnutrition, war wounds, pregnancy, and untreated diseases such as tuberculosis, jaundice and diarrhea, and that the predicted death rate in camps and detention centres is 10 per cent; and calls on the Government to raise these issues with counterparts in Turkey, to use its influence on the Security Council and more widely to try to avert the impending disaster in this region.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Amy Callaghan</span><span class="signatory">Mr Alistair Carmichael</span><span class="signatory">Mhairi Black</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises there are loopholes in the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme for new starters; acknowledges that the support offered of 80 per cent of wages up to &#163;2,500 a month is vital for workers during the coronavirus outbreak; recognises that the cut-off date of 19 March 2020 for an employer to submit an RTI notification to HMRC means in practice that people who started jobs in March are exempt from the furlough scheme; believes the Government&#8217;s proposed solution for those missed by the scheme to be re-hired by previous employers is inadequate because tight guidelines for furloughing former staff do not fit all circumstances and past employers have no legal requirement to re-hire staff; understands the lack of support offered to new starters means many households are being pushed into debt and destitution; recognises the Government&#8217;s aim to combat fraudulent claims through use of a cut-off date, but suggests other methods of doing so, such as submission of employment contracts; notes the strength of feeling among those missed by the scheme who are taking part in the #newstarterfurlough campaigns on social media; and urges the Chancellor to close the loopholes and extend the furlough scheme to new starters.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">384</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Sunday Mirror Reward frontline heroes campaign</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mick Whitley</span></p>
			<p>That this House supports the Sunday Mirror Reward frontline heroes campaign calling for a scheme to reward health and care workers for their selfless dedication and commitment in the battle against covid-19; recognises their unstinting dedication and determination, often going well beyond the call of duty, and putting stress and strain on themselves and their loved ones; pays tribute to all health and care workers who have tragically died in the line of duty as a result and expresses our heartfelt sympathy for their families and friends; believes that the Government should compensate these bereaved families; recognises that many health and care workers are shamefully low paid; believes that they are the new modern heroes; and calls on the Government to introduce immediately a pay supplement to reward health and care workers during the period of the crisis as a way of recognising the nation's gratitude; and further calls for this to be followed by a national review of the remuneration system for the whole health and  care sector to establish rates of pay based on the principles of social justice.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">389</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	27/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	17</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Claire Hanna</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Tim Farron</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that the details do not reflect the reality of self-employment in the UK; notes that the scheme calculates support based on three years of tax returns and therefore financially penalises those who have worked part time or not at all during that period because of caring responsibilities or maternity/paternity leave, as well as new starters and the recently self-employed; further notes that those who combine PAYE work with being self-employed are not eligible for a proportionate amount of support from the SEISS as well as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; notes that neither profit invested back into the development of self-employed businesses or paid as dividends to directors of small limited companies is counted as income for the purposes of the SEISS and that this is leaving many self-employed people without access to a liveable income; and therefore urges the Government to review the details of the SEISS to correct these anomalies and ensure that the scheme reflects the needs of the more than five million self-employed people in the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Angus Brendan MacNeil</p>
			<p>That this House notes that 86 per cent of pigs in the UK are slaughtered with high concentrations of CO2; notes that scientific studies report that CO2 causes severe respiratory distress, pain, and hyperventilation and gasping before loss of consciousness; acknowledges that in 2003 the Government&#8217;s Farm Animal Welfare Council concluded that the use of high concentrations of CO2 to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable and urged the practice to be phased out in five years; further notes that no such phase out has been implemented; and calls on the Government to increase the research currently being undertaken into alternative methods of slaughter with a view to phasing out stunning with high concentrations of CO2 within five years.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jonathan Edwards</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ben Lake</p>
			<p>That this House is alarmed that 25 per cent of confirmed covid-19 cases in prisons in England and Wales have been in Welsh facilities, despite only having 6 per cent of the prison population; is concerned that the number of people held in Welsh prisons reached its highest ever level in March 2020 and that HMP Swansea was the most overcrowded prison in England and Wales; is further concerned that as of 28 April, only thirty-three out of 4,000 prisoners eligible for temporary release to help tackle covid-19 have so far been released, and that the number of prisoners who will be temporarily released from Welsh establishments has not been finalised; calls on the Ministry of Justice to urgently release more of those eligible for temporary release in order to stop the rapid spread of the virus in our prison system; and stresses that those being released must pose no risk to the public and must get tested for covid-19 prior to release.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the unprecedented impact of covid-19 on the maritime economy; supports the RMT trade union&#8217;s proposals for protecting UK maritime workers from the long-term economic effects of the coronavirus crisis; calls for no compulsory redundancies of UK seafarers, dock or port workers during or after the covid-19 crisis; urges the Government to ensure that furlough and cash flow support payments only go to shipping companies that state their commitment to long term investment in employment and training for UK seafarers; demands reform of the UK Ship Register and the end Red Ensign Group to restore the link with employment for domestic Ratings and Officers in order to limit the possibility of companies and individuals to avoid tax liabilities and use low-cost labour; requests increased public funding for training and developing UK Ratings; and urges the Government to implement these necessary measures to build a resilient and stable maritime future.</p>

			<p>That this House supports World Press Freedom Day and the #FreeThePress campaign; supports the principles that journalists should be able to undertake their vital work unfettered by governments, that journalists jailed for reporting the facts should be freed, and that attacks against journalists are properly investigated with the alleged perpetrators brought to justice; notes with considerable concern the increased pressures and risks facing independent journalists and journalism worldwide during the covid-19 pandemic; calls on the Government to encourage governments overseas to uphold media freedom by not adopting or immediately repealing, disproportionate or unnecessary measures, including legislative provisions on fake news, internet restrictions, and limitations on journalists&#8217; accreditation and access during the covid-19 pandemic; and further calls on the Government to provide an update on its activities in relation to its global media freedom campaign launched last year, and to condemn publicly and hold to account governments including China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, Egypt, Eritrea and Azerbaijan, that feature at the bottom of the latest Reporters Without Borders&#8217; annual world press freedom index.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the updated Construction Leadership Council guidance version three is considerably weaker than version two; is particularly troubled by the relaxation of measures relating to social distancing; is worried about the implications of this on the health and safety of construction workers and the wider public; urges contractors and clients to enforce on site social distancing; further urges contractors and clients to prove they are taking their moral duty to construction workers seriously by staggering site opening times to allow workers to social distance by avoiding overcrowded public transport; understands the importance of key workers not only feeling safe in the workplace but from when they leave their home to start work to when they return home after finishing work; and supports the withdrawal of the Construction Leadership Council guidance and the implementation of tougher procedures, which are strictly enforced.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the Child Poverty Action Group and the Church of England&#8217;s report, published 5 May 2020, which found that an estimated 60,000 families will be affected by the two-child limit as a result of the covid-19 crisis, joining around 230,000 families affected by the policy since April 2017; is alarmed that as parents get ill, lose their job, or experience a fall in their income as a result of the coronavirus, a growing number of families are discovering that the safety net that should be provided by the social security system is not adequate to meet their needs; and calls on the Government to abolish the two-child limit and ensure that people get the support they need, when they need it, as a part of a comprehensive strategy to tackle poverty in all its forms.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the emerging trend of criminals seeking to exploit coronavirus with a new range of scams; welcomes the free scam alerts set up by Which?; urges people to forward any suspicious emails to the National Cyber Security Centre, and to highlight any online scams of which they become aware to the authorities so they can be removed; is concerned that scammers are using any means available, including emails, text messages, phone calls and even doorstep visits to perpetrate fraud; understands that scammers are taking advantage of the fact we are increasingly interacting online, with the UK&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre taking down more than 2,000 online coronavirus scams last month, including 471 fake online shops, 555 malicious content websites and&#160;200 phishing sites seeking to obtain personal information such as passwords and card details; recognises some common scams have recently developed including the selling of fake coronavirus tests, fake vaccines and cures, bogus messages from HMRC regarding tax refunds and even demands that people pay fines for breaking lockdown rules; acknowledges that scam emails and other correspondence purporting to be from legitimate sources are often sophisticated and appear completely authentic; understands that people are safer if they only buy from trusted and legitimate retailers, and are extremely vigilant regarding any unsolicited contact at this time; and affirms that much like the coronavirus pandemic, it is only by coming together to protect one another that ruthless criminals seeking to profit from this health crisis will be defeated.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses its gratitude to the tens of thousands of workers across the civil service who are playing absolutely critical frontline roles at this time of the covid-19 epidemic; praises their dedication and professionalism at this testing time; notes that Department for Work Pensions' staff are coping with an unprecedented spike in claims for universal credit; further notes that HMRC workers are processing applications to the Job Retention Scheme vital to protecting jobs and livelihoods; regrets that these members have seen a prolonged pay squeeze in real terms since the onset of austerity following the financial crisis, and that many are now understandably worried about their own financial circumstances; believe that it is in everyone&#8217;s interest to allow the civil service workers to dedicate all of their attention to coming to grips with the present crisis, rather than having to engage with the highly fragmented series of pay bargaining processes across the civil service; commends the civil service union PCS for putting forward constructive proposals for an interim agreement for the duration of the crisis based on an above-inflation pay settlement; welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to enter into such agreement; and therefore calls on the UK Government to follow suit in reaching an agreement over pay, and also to implement a moratorium on redundancies and office closures.</p>
