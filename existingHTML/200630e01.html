			<p>That this House notes the 20th anniversary of the death of racing legend Joey Dunlop on 2 of July 2000 in Tallinn, Estonia, while leading a 125cc race, having already won the 750cc and 600cc events, on the Pirita-Kose-Kloostrimetsa Circuit; remembers with great fondness this working class hero whose humanitarian work with orphans in Romania earned him an OBE to go along with his MBE for services to motorbike racing as a sport; and extends our thoughts and prayers to the family of this true gentleman who is still thought of and missed.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Girvan</p>
			<p>That this House commemorates the 25th anniversary of the passing of Gordon Wilson who was a tremendous advocate for peace during the Troubles; notes that he won the BBC Today programme's man of the year due to his determination to see good brought out of evil and to forgive those who had murdered his daughter; and encourages those who are remembering and celebrating men of war at present to remember that blessed are the peacemakers.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">671</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Professor Philip Taylor&#8217;s report on the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	30/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patrick Grady</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the publication of a report into the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers by Philip Taylor, Professor of Work and Employment Studies, at the University of Strathclyde; recognises that the report raises concerns about unsafe working environments at many call centres including poor social distancing measures, hot-desking, poor cleansing and a lack of remote or home-working options; notes that the report records concerning levels of anxiety and fear among call-centre staff regarding their risk of catching or transferring covid-19 in their workplace; further notes that the report considers the matter to be as much a public health concern as an occupational health issue due to the risk of call centre workers spreading infection; appreciates that, while the document is focused on Scotland, the content and recommendations are equally applicable to the rest of the UK; further recognises that the report makes a number of recommendations including evacuating problematic workplaces, facilitating greater homeworking, auditing call centres and the implementation of appropriate health and safety and testing measures; and calls on the Government to reflect on the evidence and recommendations in that report and consider what actions it can take to help protect call centre workers throughout the UK.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">672</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Intelligence and Security Committee Report on alleged Russian interference in UK Democracy</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wera Hobhouse</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Stephen Farry</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dame Margaret Hodge</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Alistair Carmichael</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to urgently reinstate the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it can publish the delayed report on alleged Russian Interference in UK democracy; notes that this is the longest period following an election that the Intelligence and Security Committee has gone without being reinstated; and calls on the Government to be fully transparent and open with the public about any activity which may compromise the integrity of our democracy.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">673</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Reinstatement of benefit sanctions</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	30/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p>That this House believes that the decision to reinstate benefit sanctions in the middle of a health and economic crisis is a profoundly callous step; further believes that this is an ideologically driven, punitive measure which simply adds to the stress and anxiety for people who are already facing hard times; notes that removing benefits and forcing people to use food banks to feed their families does nothing to help anyone back to work; and urgently calls on the Government to extend the suspension of sanctions as the covid-19 crisis continues and the numbers claiming universal credit soar, with a view to scrapping benefit sanctions altogether.</p>

			<p>That this House views with grave concern the decision taken by Bahrain&#8217;s Court of Cassation on 15 June 2020 to uphold the death sentences of Zuhair Ibrahim Jasim Abdullah and Hussein Abdullah Khalil Rashid; notes with alarm that neither man was allowed to attend their final appeal hearing and deeply regrets that despite three UN experts documenting due process violations against 20 individuals including Zuhair and Husain in December 2018, including acts of torture over a 13 day period against Zuhair, that both men have now exhausted all legal remedies and they now face execution pending ratification of the death sentence by the King of Bahrain; reminds the Bahraini authorities that the UN experts stated that under these circumstances, carrying out this death sentence would amount to summary executions;f further notes Bahrain&#8217;s increased use of the death penalty since a moratorium ended in 2017 with the execution of three men, followed by the execution of three more by firing squad in July 2019, thereby raising fears that the sentences passed down on Zuhair Ibrahim Jasim Abdullah and Hussein Abdullah Khalil Rashid could be carried out imminently despite serious and ongoing concerns as to the safety of their convictions; and calls on the UK Government to unreservedly condemn these sentences and asks that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office use whatever influence it has with the Bahraini authorities to seek an immediate commutation of these sentences</p>

			<p>That this House notes that currently in the UK there are an unknown number of persons who are not UK citizens, who do not have leave to remain in this country, who lack any entitlement to support from the state, who are therefore entirely without funds to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families and who are unable to comply with Government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing; and considers it essential that the Government takes immediate action to ensure that leave to remain in the UK is granted to all such persons who are within the UK but are not citizens, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status, so that they can access healthcare, food and housing to enable them to adhere to Government advice on social distancing, ensure the health of themselves and their families and help protect the health of all people in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that as at 21 June 2020, 1.1 Million employers and 9.2 Million Jobs were being supported through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at a cost of &#163;22.9 Billion; notes with grave concern the effect on whole swathes of the economy of the scheduled cessation of the scheme on 31st October; notes the immoral situation of employers using the Job Retention Scheme to consult on making jobs redundant, in many cases permanently and in others to rehire staff on inferior wages, terms and conditions; further notes that the Government does not measure how many firms are engaged in such behaviour; urges the Government to remove an arbitrary cut-off date for the Job Retention Scheme and to provide significant support to critically affected sectors to avoid widespread job losses, to immediately assess the effect of firms misusing the scheme to cover costs during redundancy consultation periods, to commit to providing regular updates on those matters, to bring forward legislative proposals to close loopholes which enable unscrupulous employers to benefit from the Job Retention Scheme whilst reducing jobs and attacking employees&#8217; wages, terms and conditions.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of ensuring that, upon their discovery, treatments and vaccines for covid-19 are shared equitably around the world; highlights that any potential vaccine should be made available to all internationally on the basis of need; notes that in advance of the discovery of a vaccine the UK Government must urge its allies including the US to participate in a system of international cooperation to ensure that vaccines are not simply sold to the highest bidder; and believes that a unified intergovernmental approach to vaccine distribution is not only the right thing to do, but is also the most efficient way to defeat the virus worldwide and prevent future pandemics.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the decision of The Doctors Laboratory, the UK subsidiary of the Australian multinational Sonic Healthcare Limited, to dismiss 10 bicycle and walking couriers, who have been transporting covid-19 samples among other items in the middle of the pandemic; notes that key workers such as them have played a vital role in the UK response to the pandemic; believes that companies have a duty to do everything possible to protect key workers; further notes that the Health and Safety Executive is currently investigating The Doctors Laboratory over allegations that the company did not sufficiently protect the health and safety of its couriers; highlights that The Doctors Laboratory contracts with the NHS and plans future growth on the further privatisation of the NHS; believes that NHS privatisation is wrong and that any private companies currently doing business with the NHS must be held to the highest ethical standards; and calls on the Government to conduct a review into The Doctors Laboratory&#8217;s practices, which takes evidence from workers, unions, and NHS partners, and publish the results.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that as a result of measures taken to halt the spread of covid-19, live performances have been unable to take place; further notes that live music events have all but ceased to exist and as a consequence, many performers and those providing light and sound services have had no income during the covid-19 lockdown; expresses great concern that, without urgent additional Government support, many performers and the companies that support them face imminent financial ruin; and calls on Government to put together an urgent package of support to enable live performances to survive.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that prison employers must by law take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure the health and safety of their staff; further notes that eight national trades unions representing the majority of prison staff have called for new best-practice safety measures, including a whistleblowing hotline, before current coronavirus restrictions are relaxed; agrees with those unions that there can be no going back to the intolerably high levels of violence suffered by prison staff before the current restrictions; further agrees that the Prison Service should adopt a co-ordinated approach to reducing health and safety risks by working constructively with all prison unions, including those representing non-directly employed staff; urges the Government to commit to intervening if necessary to prevent prison governors or contractors from enforcing unsafe working practices, both during and after the coronavirus pandemic; and further urges the Government to support a whistleblowing hotline and other proposed union measures, including a know-your-rights campaign, proper protection for workers who raise health and safety concerns and a commitment not to sanction staff who are genuinely unable to return to the workplace due to this pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the &#163;354 million of arrears owed to families under the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) with just &#163;31 million having been collected through enforcement action in the latest quarter; futher notes that 43 per cent of cases under Collect and Pay arrangements are not receiving any maintenance; recognises that according to a 2019 study by Hakovirta et al, the full and timely payment of maintenance could lift 60 per cent of families living in poverty out of poverty; further recognises the increased hardship families are facing as a result of covied-19; supports those single-parents seeking a judicial review of the Department for Work and Pensions for their persistent failure to collect maintenance; calls on the Government to take action to secure the maintenance to which families have a legal right, including a root and branch review of the CMS to ensure it works effectively for the children it is supposed to serve, to increase enforcement action against non-compliant, non-resident parents, to improve enforcement powers for the CMS, and to introduce a Minimum Maintenance Payment to provide parents-with-care and their children a guaranteed income to prevent hardship and ensure a dignified standard of living.</p>
