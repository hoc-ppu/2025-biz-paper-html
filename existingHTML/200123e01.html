			<p class="MotionSponsor">David Linden</p>
			<p>That this House warmly congratulates the congregation at The Charter in Tollcross, Glasgow on celebrating its first anniversary; notes that The Charter which was formerly a public house has bucked a trend of Churches being converted into public houses and done the opposite; celebrates the growth of the congregation over the last year as well as its recent baptisms and wishes the congregation, led by Pastor John Craig, well for the future as they continues to minister God's word and serve the community of Tollcross.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rachel Hopkins</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that Government cuts to local government funding are reducing the ability for arts and culture to improve society&#8217;s health and wellbeing; notes that this lack of investment undermines health care professional's capability to deliver effective social prescribing initiatives through wider community groups which can provide emotional and practical support to those dealing with loneliness, mental health issues and complex social needs; further notes that social prescribing can improve health and wellbeing while simultaneously reducing the pressure on clinical health care services; and calls on the Government to increase investment in social prescribing as part of its public health strategy.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Minister for the Cabinet Office to take immediate steps to ensure the relevant Scottish National Party candidate is appointed to take the place in the European Parliament vacated by the hon. Member for Stirling on his election to this House; notes that Scotland returned four out of six Members of the European Parliament with a mandate to oppose Brexit in the elections held on 23 May 2019; and believes Scotland must be fully represented in Brussels when the European Parliament votes on the Withdrawal Agreement on 29 January 2020, and that failure on the part of the UK Government to appoint an SNP candidate to fill this vacancy would represent inherent disregard of the democratically expressed views of the people of Scotland and the electoral process of the United Kingdom.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the benefits of prescribed medical cannabis for people suffering with chronic pain, epilepsy and a variety of other conditions; welcomes the legalisation around the use of prescribed medical cannabis on 1 November 2018; but regrets the difficulties patients and their families continue to face accessing prescribed medical cannabis that their consultants have prescribed through the NHS; further regrets the restrictive NHS guidelines that prevents most patients from accessing it and deters specialist consultants from prescribing it; condemns the two-tier system that this has created where only those who can afford to pay for the prescription have easy and ready access to prescribed medical cannabis; and calls on the Government to use every means necessary to ensure that NHS patients have easy access to prescribed medical cannabis should their specialist consultant prescribe it for them</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Maria Eagle</span><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House is aware that the hormone pregnancy drug test, Primodos, was taken by approximately 1.5 million women in the 1960s and 1970s to test for pregnancy; understands that there is considerable evidence that many women who took this drug either gave birth to babies with serious deformities, miscarried, or had stillbirths, with the babies affected now in their 40s and 50s, having experienced a lifetime with serious disabilities; seeks answers as to why no official warnings were issued about this drug until eight years after the first major report that indicated possible dangers; is alarmed that some doctors were still prescribing this drug for pregnant women after official warnings were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines; has deep concerns about the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-led expert working group's review of this issue which seems to have been shrouded in secrecy; urges the UK Government to fully respond to concerns raised about the methodology of this review, the independence of the panel members, the conclusions of the report and the fact that key information seems to have been withheld from the report in order to suggest that there is no link between Primodos and birth defects; welcomes the announcement by the former Prime Minister in February 2018 of a review of this scandal involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos; and urges the current Prime Minister to ensure that a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter is established without delay, to ensure justice for those affected.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates those who took part in the march of 11 January 2020 in Glasgow in support of Scottish independence; commends the resolute determination of the marchers who braved horrendous weather to make their voices heard; understands that it was estimated that tens of thousands of people participated in the march; respects that these citizens were asserting the nation of Scotland's right to decide to choose its own future; recognises that this follows on from the election of more than 80 per cent of Scotland's MPs standing on a manifesto calling for Scotland's future to be in Scotland's hands; understands that for the first time in history Members elected from the two principal countries within the UK have different constitutional mandates for their respective countries; is mindful of the fact that any denial of the democratic will of the people of Scotland in seeking to determine their own future contradicts principles of equality and ignores the Claim of Right for Scotland, that the people of Scotland have the sovereign right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs; appreciates that this right is well established and was most recently endorsed by the House of Commons in July 2018; and asserts that all attempts to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people to choose their own future are unsustainable.</p>
