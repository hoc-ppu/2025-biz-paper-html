			<p class="MotionSponsor">John Nicolson</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of people working from home to protect the NHS and limit the spread of covid-19; notes that many workers lack the equipment to work effectively from home and often cannot afford to pay for expensive equipment without financial support from employers; encourages the Government to work with employers to remove the barriers which prevent people from working from home; and calls for the Government to consider the introduction of legislation to reduce the cost of remote technology and office supplies for businesses aiming to facilitate home-working.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the difference in lockdown regulations between Wales and England; notes that the Welsh Government is still advising against all non-essential travel and requires the people of Wales to stay at home except for very limited purposes; calls on the UK Government to ensure that clear information will be published on all cross-border public transport in the form of large posters and spoken announcements to inform commuters that only essential travel can be made to Wales in accordance with Welsh law; and further calls on the UK Government to provide proper enforcement by the British Transport Police to ensure that the public abide by the regulations set out by the Welsh Government.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jon Trickett</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Ian Lavery</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned about the high number of tenants who have lost income during the coronavirus crisis; further concerned about the number of tenants who are in rent arrears and are at risk of eviction as soon as the temporary freeze on evictions is lifted; notes that this crisis comes at a time when our housing system already prioritises the private profits of landlords over the rights of tenants; is concerned about reports of tenants being pressured into paying rent when that leaves them without enough money for food or other essentials; commends the work of tenant and community unions including ACORN, Living Rent and the London Renters Union in organising to protect communities during this crisis; calls on the Government to suspend rent immediately for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis, cancel rent arrears accrued during the crisis and protect renters from eviction so that no one loses their home while they are trying to cope with Coronavirus and its aftermath.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p>That this House recognises East Lothian's fundraising efforts in raising &#163;35,477 for Christian Aid Week; acknowledges this achievement places East Lothian in the 17th position in raising the most out of all constituencies across the UK; notes these funds will go towards supporting those who have been hardest hit by the coronavirus in developing countries; recognises this act of kindness of all those who have contributed to this cause from across the community of East Lothian.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">421</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Universal Credit, Maternity Allowance &amp; SMP</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	4/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	77</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wera Hobhouse</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mark Tami</span></p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ms Diane Abbott</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jon Trickett</span><span class="signatory">Sarah Olney</span></p>
			<p>That this House is alarmed at the growing evidence that black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) people are over-represented in hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19  and that there are clear systemic economic inequalities that are meaning that ethnic minority communities are being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus crisis; is concerned at reports that almost three quarters of NHS and social care staff who have died of covid-19 have a BAME background; laments that years of austerity has had an utterly devastating impact on ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately disadvantaged by public sector cuts; and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety of BAME workers, particularly NHS and care staff, on the frontline and to take immediate action to address the unequal health and economic effects of covid-19 on the UK&#8217;s black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) groups.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">428</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Redundancies at British Airways</h3>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jeremy Corbyn</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the Government&#8217;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled it to work with businesses and trade unions to protect the economy and avoid mass redundancies; appreciates the role aviation workers have played in operating flights, repatriating citizens and delivering essential medical and personal protective equipment supplies; considers it deplorable that whilst IAG is taking UK tax payers&#8217; money, as well as using Spanish government guaranteed loans to purchase an additional airline for the group at a cost of &#8364;1.2 Billion, it is serving notice of redundancies to UK employees with</p>
			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kate Osborne</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jeremy Corbyn</span></p>
			<p>That this House pays its respects to the bus drivers that have succumbed to covid-19 during this crisis, including 27 London bus drivers; thanks all bus drivers for their service; notes the invaluable job that bus drivers are doing to keep this country running; stresses that measures must be put in place to prevent further deaths; urges bus operators to close the front door of buses to the public where possible, to limit the risk of covid-19 transmission by stopping cash payments, to reduce passenger numbers and to guarantee bus drivers&#8217; breaks are not taken on the road but in clean, safe areas that are compliant with social distancing; pushes for temperature checks of drivers by laser on arrival at bus garages; understands that a high temperature would result in a driver then accessing a covid-19 test and self-isolating on full pay while awaiting the results in order to prevent further potential transmission of the virus; recognises that such tests could be life-saving and prevent the deaths of key workers; and welcomes the work done by Transport for London and Tower Transit in piloting these ground-breaking temperature checks at a London bus garage.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jeremy Corbyn</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern that British Airways has made 12,000 staff redundant; thanks these workers for their heroic efforts in repatriating those stranded due to covid-19 at their own risk; offers solidarity to these workers that find themselves needlessly out of a job in the middle of a global pandemic; is disappointed that British Airways chose to take the decision to reject Government support and announce it on International Workers&#8217; Memorial Day; emphasises that, as an island, aviation is essential to the UK for trade, business and managing social and family networks; looks to the governments of our European neighbours who are taking action to protect their aviation industries; urges the Government to provide fully-repayable loans and take a financial stake in aviation companies; asks aviation companies to cap all elements of executive pay, protect employee terms and conditions and transition to greener, more efficient travel operations once flights resume; and calls on the Government to publicly finance smaller airports, air traffic control and specific routes within the UK aviation network to retain much-needed vital connectivity.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the aviation industry to the national and regional economies of the UK; acknowledges the aviation industry's efforts to achieve sustainability and specifically its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the Government's overall target for the UK; acknowledges the immense impact of the covid-19 pandemic on aviation and connected sectors including leisure and tourism; understands that there will likely be a lag in the recovery of these sectors when lockdown restrictions are lifted and that this will require continued support from Government; recognises the industry&#8217;s need for advance notice of changes to accommodate the long planning horizon for restoring services; notes with concern the announcement of large numbers of redundancies in the sector; is concerned about the impact of the covid-19 crisis on the future of the industry and its ability to achieve its sustainability objectives; notes the importance of Government measures such as the job retention scheme to aviation businesses; and urges the Government and the aviation industry to work together on a solution that provides the necessary support through the crisis, protects jobs and ensures that the industry can achieve sustainability.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s establishment of Consumer Scotland, a new consumer body which will  be operational by next year; understands that it will be dedicated to protecting the interests of consumers, focusing on campaigning on issues that particularly affect people in Scotland and will conduct in-depth investigations to identify and address causes of consumer harm; notes that it is extremely important to have a powerful advocacy voice for consumers; expresses confidence that Consumer Scotland will help to ensure that a fairer Scotland means fairer outcomes for consumers; and highlights that more could be done to protect consumers in Scotland if consumer law was devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the plans of the new Israeli coalition government to annex part of the occupied West Bank; further notes that Israeli legislation can progress from 1 July 2020 to carry out such an annexation; highlights that any such annexation of territory occupied in 1967 is a breach of international law which rejects any acquisition of territory through force and that it would be a major threat to peace; notes that when Russia illegally annexed the Crimea in 2014, the UK joined EU partners in imposing sanctions on that country; calls on the Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that such a step will have severe consequences for the UK-Israel relationship; and further calls on the Government to introduce sanctions similar to those impose on Russia in the event that an annexation of occupied territory takes place.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; proposal to make 1,100 redundancies amongst key workers in Dover and Hull; further notes that this includes over 730 seafarer ratings who make up 8 per cent of the total UK workforce; offers support to the workers and families in coastal communities affected by this decision which is reminiscent of P&amp;O&#8217;s attacks on British seafarer jobs and trade unions in the 1980s; notes that P&amp;O has received an undisclosed figure from the taxpayer to keep freight routes from the UK running and over &#163;10 million public funding to pay 80 per cent of the wages of 1,400 furloughed staff members, some of whom now face redundancy; believes that any public funding received by shipping companies to address the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic should be conditional on the protection of UK seafarer jobs; further notes that P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; parent company DP World made &#163;1.3 billion profit last year and paid a &#163;270 million dividend to shareholders at the end of April 2020; believes that P&amp;O is seeking to permanently replace British crews with cheaper foreign crews using the low-cost crewing model, including on the fleet of new Ro-Ro passenger ferries on order from a Chinese shipyard for the Dover-Calais route; and calls on the Government to intervene immediately in order to save British seafarers&#8217; jobs at P&amp;O Ferries.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain&#8217;s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as &#163;40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>
