			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges that the Department for Work and Pensions commissioned an evidence review on the drivers of food bank use in 2018; notes the Government's commitment to this House to publish the findings of the review; further notes the Government's failure to date to publish those findings; and urges the Government to provide a clear deadline as a matter of urgency for the publication of the review to inform a public debate on the reasons for growing demand for food aid provision in the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Barry Sheerman</p>
			<p>That this House expresses its concern at the continued imprisonment of British national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe; urges the Government to act purposefully to negotiate her release; supports a review into the steps taken so far by this and previous Governments to secure her release; stands in solidarity with Nazanin&#8217;s family and loved ones; and considers the role of an all-faith delegation in petitioning for Nazanin&#8217;s release.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Anne McLaughlin</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the success of St Paul&#8217;s Youth Forum in the North East of Glasgow on reducing gang related violence by 97 per cent since 2006; recognises the number of youth crimes reduced from 116 in 2006 to just two in 2016 and understands they achieved this by investing just &#163;80,000 a year in dedicated youth work; applauds the breadth of work undertaken by the young people and youth workers, from the health and wellbeing project where vegetables are grown and eaten locally to the youth led local radio station BOLT FM, and from On Bikes which enables young people to make use of and repair bicycles to youth exchange trips from Blackhill and Provanmill to Zambia; endorses the approach of empowering young people to take on responsibility for the project; and applauds trustees of the board and the dedicated staff and volunteers led by Neil Young.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Anne McLaughlin</p>
			<p>That this House is very concerned by the crackdown on peaceful protest and the media in The Gambia, following the use of excessive force by security forces last month to disperse protesters calling for President Adama Barrow to fulfil his pledge to step down after three years in power, resulting in many injuries and three deaths, as well as the closure of two FM radio stations and charges of incitement brought against at least two journalists; notes that despite some progress since the departure of former President Yahya Jammeh, allegedly responsible for forced disappearances, rape and murder during two decades of authoritarian rule, serious human rights violations still need to be addressed and accountability mechanisms strengthened; urges the Gambian Government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens, including by unconditionally releasing all those detained for exercising their right to peaceful protest, reopening radio stations it closed and releasing detained journalists; and calls on the Government, with the international community, to support the Gambian Government and civil society in the transition from dictatorship to democracy, as well as to engage with them under the auspices of the UK&#8217;s current Global Media Freedom campaign.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the life and work of Sam Macartney, a UNISON activist for 35 years, who died on the 24 January 2020; recognises his work as a Senior Steward within Glasgow&#8217;s learning disability day care services, and the Conditions of Service Officer within the Glasgow City Branch of UNISON; and sends condolences to his family at this time; recognises his work as the Chair of the UNISON Scotland International Committee, alongside his international work within the UK Trade Union and the Scottish Trades Union Congress; further recognises his work on Palestine, Venezuela, Cuba, Southern Africa, the industrial disaster in Bhopal, India, which he visited in 2014 to mark its 30th Anniversary, and campaigner for the Kurdish people; celebrates his work in his trade union activities; and recognises the esteem in which he was held by his many friends and colleagues; and offers condolences to all who knew him at this time.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">146</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Peter Grant</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Paul Blomfield</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ms Angela Eagle</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tonia Antoniazzi</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jess Phillips</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the overturning by the High Court of Justice Tolson&#8217;s ruling in the Central Family Court that a sexual assault did not constitute rape because the woman had taken no physical step to encourage the man to desist; notes with concern the High Court&#8217;s findings that Justice Tolson failed to apply the definitions of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour, dismissed or ignored reports from the police, failed to allow the Appellant to make her full submission and repeatedly interrupted her; further notes with concern the High Court&#8217;s findings on Justice Tolson&#8217;s judgment that the real risk of the appearance of a partisan approach in that judge&#8217;s conduct was self-evident and that the fact that the judge preferred the Respondent&#8217;s case was patent throughout his judgment; highlights the High Court&#8217;s further findings that Justice Tolson&#8217;s reasons for dismissing the evidence of the Appellant were wrong, specifically, that he made a finding regarding the Appellant&#8217;s psychological state of mind without any forensic expert evidence; further highlights that the High Court found that Justice Tolson&#8217;s approach towards the issue of consent was manifestly at odds with current jurisprudence, concomitant sexual behaviour, and what is currently acceptable socio-sexual conduct; notes with concern that Justice Tolson continues to preside over cases involving domestic abuse and rape in the Family Courts; and calls on the Government to take steps with the Judicial College to ensure that training is made mandatory for family court and criminal court judges on the legally correct and appropriate approach to take when hearing domestic abuse and sexual assault allegations.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Tommy Sheppard</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the inauguration of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong to promote democracy and the rule of law, and to defend human rights in Hong Kong, to share information about Hong Kong, and to nurture relations between the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong; notes that the inaugural meeting heard chilling testimony from a consultant surgeon who provides humanitarian aid to those injured in the protests, including police, protestors and bystanders, and who reported having treated the kind of injuries seen in wars; is profoundly concerned by reports of the arrest and public humiliation of those providing medical assistance to the injured; observes that video footage of police brutality demonstrates that the Hong Kong police are failing to adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Guidance on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement; further observes that the arrest of those providing humanitarian assistance is contrary to international law and the global consensus on fundamental human rights of access to medical treatment; is alarmed that failure of the international community to condemn these breaches by the Hong Kong police would set a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, placing in grave jeopardy the lives and welfare of humanitarian aid workers around the world, including providers of medical and other aid from the United Kingdom; and calls on the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to raise these concerns with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that there are thousands of unaccompanied child refugees throughout Europe living in desperate circumstances; welcomes the Government&#8217;s statement that it will ensure unaccompanied children will continue to be able to come to the UK to join a relative; notes with concern the removal of that protection from the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2019-20; further notes that the removal of legal protections for separated child refugees may lead to more children undertaking dangerous journeys in order to be reunited with their families; and calls on the Government to enshrine its commitment in law to ensure the ongoing protection of those vulnerable children and their right to reunification with their families.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Bob Blackman</span><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises and celebrates the importance of vibrant oceans to our global ecosystem; notes that our oceans are facing a variety of threats, including large amounts of waste of all kinds being disposed of in them, overfishing and human caused climate change, and that the creatures within them are especially vulnerable to even slight changes in global temperatures; regrets that studies have found that only 13 per cent of the ocean has been unharmed by human activity, that 50 per cent of global coral has died since 1980, that 72 marine species are listed as critically endangered, and that over a third of marine mammal species face extinction; recalls the work of the Blue Belt Programme in UK Overseas Territories; welcomes the Greenpeace Ocean Declaration on the ongoing negotiations towards a Global Ocean Treaty and calls upon the Government to be bold in pursuing meaningful negotiations to establish, significantly expand and enforce global ocean sanctuaries, and to drive a global shift towards a collaborative, but also effective, global decision making process to help protect global oceans.</p>

			<p>That this House supports members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) employed by Interserve at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who will embark on a month of strike action throughout February 2020; notes that this dispute has been ongoing since March 2019 over issues including pay, trade union recognition, removal of working hours for cleaners and sick pay; further notes that the last strike ballot in October 2019 returned a 100 per cent vote in support of further strike action on an 82.5 per cent turnout; commends the efforts of PCS in their attempts throughout this dispute to seek resolution via the conciliator, ACAS, and their calls for urgent meetings with the employer and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs during the most recent ballot period; is concerned that treatment of staff employed by Interserve at the FCO has worsened in recent months, with those involved in the dispute excluded from festive activities and attempts being made by their employer to close their designated break room; notes that no worker takes the decision to go on strike lightly; and therefore calls on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to bring an end to this dispute and ensure all workers in Government are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

			<p>This House notes that a claimant of universal credit that is approaching state pension age may be subject to nine weeks without income between the end of universal credit and the first payment of the state pension if they are not eligible for pension credit; further notes that that period includes up to thirty days in which no benefit is payable and that the  final universal credit assessment period can be reduced and paid on a pro-rata basis; and calls on the Government to ensure that universal credit is payable up to the day before the state pension is paid, regardless of whether pension credit is subsequently payable.</p>

			<p>That this House warmly congratulates Liberty-GFG Alliance on celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Lochaber aluminium smelter, the UK&#8217;s only aluminium smelter, which started production in December 1929; welcomes the fact that former employees joined present day staff to view a number of exhibitions covering the history of the plant and its relationship with the local community as a major employer to this day; commends the fact that the plant has increased its workforce by 26 per cent since the GFG Alliance acquired the facility three years ago and applauds the organisation&#8217;s ambitious and attainable commitment to carbon neutrality, demonstrated by the fact the facility has a target of being carbon neutral by 2030; endorses the recent announcement that GFG Alliance has recently become part of the global aluminium enterprise known as ALVANCE aluminium group, which will facilitate implementation and training for new downstream production methods which will benefit staff at the Fort William facility, creating further employment in the future; and wishes all staff and management further success going forward.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights World Wetlands Day and the tremendous work that is carried out by the Wetlands Trust every day of the year; notes the importance of the fact that 40 per cent of all species live or breed in Wetlands and that peatlands store 30 per cent of land based carbon; and thanks all of those who tend to and enhance biodiversity and give the time and resources to make a real difference to the environment in this way.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the Government has for over two decades failed women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of the changes that were made to their state pension age due to equalisation brought on by the Pensions Act 1995; regrets that the Government only began writing to women affected from 2009 onward; acknowledges that the Scottish National Party previously submitted a fully funded proposal to help women born in the 1950s that was rejected by the Government; believes the onus is now on the Government to remedy the injustices suffered by millions of women across the UK; and calls on the Government to oversee a full impact assessment, which takes into account the wide reaching effects of its policy, and to make a decision on the recompense that affected women will receive based on the findings of such an assessment.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the success of the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit through its intelligence-led role in the prevention and detection of crimes relating to a wide range of wildlife issues; recognises that the unit provides specialist skills, knowledge and expertise to the Police, UK Border Force, HM Revenue and Customs, Animal Plant and Health Agency, EUROPOL and INTERPOL, the UK Government and a significant network of non-government and civil society organisations; considers that the Unit has a vital role to play in fulfilling the UK's commitments to combating illegal wildlife trade internationally; recognises the pro-active steps taken by the unit in the formation of a cyber-enabled wildlife crime priority delivery group; further recognises that permanent funding would allow the unit to plan ahead and retain expert staff; and calls on the Government to provide permanent funding to the National Wildlife Crime Unit.</p>
