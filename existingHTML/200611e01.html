			<p>That this House notes the Public and Commercial Services Union national campaign &#8216;Dying for sick pay&#8217; which marks the 30th anniversary of International Justice Day for Cleaners and Security and calls on Government to extend full occupational sick pay from day one for all outsourced workers on civil service contracts; is aware that outsourced civil service contracts are awarded with a requirement to only pay staff Statutory Sick Pay from the fourth day of sickness leading to an average 70% reduction in staffs normal pay; is concerned that this policy negatively impacts on the lowest paid working in the civil service, predominantly female BAME facilities management workforce; further notes that members of PCS including cleaners, security guards, porters and facilities management staff all of whom contribute greatly to the day to day functionality of government departments; applauds their dedication during the pandemic and notes the great risk to these workers and their families in their roles as key workers providing the first line of defence against Coronavirus; is concerned that the government intends to return to the unequal and inadequate system of SSP post lockdown despite most civil service departments adopting a policy of paying outsourced staff in fully for Covid-19 related absences; believes that all civil service employees including those directly employed by government and those on outsourced contracts deserve access to full sick pay from day one; and calls on the Government support this campaign and end inequality in sick pay.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">521</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>UK law on disability-selective abortion</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	2/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	30</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carla Lockhart</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Gregory Campbell</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sammy Wilson</span><span class="signatory">Mrs Emma Lewell-Buck</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the publication by WHO, UNICEF and IBFAN of the 2020 Status Report on the Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (BMS): National Implementation of the International Code; notes that over the past two years, protections against inappropriate marketing of BMS have been strengthened in 44 countries around the world; appreciates that as of April 2020, 136 (70 per cent) of 194 WHO Member States had enacted legal measures with provisions to implement the Code; is disappointed that health facilities and staff around the world are still being targeted through the provision of materials and equipment by companies who have an interest in the promotion of infant formula; notes that the UK only scores 39 out of a possible 100 on implementation of measures covered by the Code, with particular weaknesses in monitoring and enforcement, promotion of BMS in health facilities, and engagement with health workers; calls on the Government to recognise their obligations, both under international human rights law and international agreements, to promote and protect breastfeeding, to eliminate inappropriate marketing practices, to analyse and address weaknesses in existing legislation and act accordingly; believes that such actions must be backed up with appropriate funding; and requests that the Government takes action to fully implement the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and all subsequent resolutions prior to the 40th anniversary of the Code in 2021.</p>
