			<p class="MotionSponsor">Andy Slaughter</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the publication of the UN&#8217;s database of companies operating in Israeli settlements; acknowledges that all Israeli settlements are illegal and that the transfer of a civilian population to an occupied territory is a war crime under international law; notes that complicity in war crimes is a serious criminal offence; reaffirms the Government&#8217;s obligation to uphold international law, and the corporate responsibility of companies to respect human rights, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles; is alarmed that UK businesses are listed in the UN database, while also recognising that the database itself is not exhaustive of all companies supporting illegal settlement infrastructure; welcomes the report of Amnesty International highlighting that companies cannot do business in or with settlements without contributing to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; and calls on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and under customary international humanitarian law, by banning UK trade with illegal settlements and making binding regulations for companies to uphold human rights standards.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rachel Hopkins</p>
			<p>That this House notes that workers in Higher Education (HE) have suffered a 17 per cent pay cut since 2009, a 15.1 per cent gender pay gap and a 26 per cent black and minority ethnic pay gap; further notes that in some Higher Education Institutions, 40 percent of staff are employed on temporary or casual contracts; notes that, according to surveys, university staff work an average of 51 hours per week and that there is an ongoing epidemic of poor mental health in that sector; believes that staff working conditions affect student learning and that this is damaging to both students&#8217; education and the quality and reputation of UK HE and has an effect of the marketisation of HE funding and provision; supports the 14 day industrial action called by the University and College&#8217;s Union (UCU) for fairer pay, gender and BAME equality, more realistic workloads, more equitable pension contributions and an end to casualisation; calls on the employers to take action to address the legitimate concerns of university staff and the ongoing crisis in HE; and further calls on the Government to work with the employers and UCU to resolve that dispute and end the marketisation of the sector.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>
			<p>That this House highlights that it is unacceptable that in 2020 women and girls pay more than men for basic products, including toiletries, clothes, and haircuts; notes that products marketed at women are, in some cases, 34 per cent more expensive than those aimed at men; further notes that the unfair price gap will have a significant financial effect on a woman over the course of her life; regrets that women are subject to the additional injustice of the gender pay gap, which sees 8 out of 10 companies still paying more to their male employees; commends companies that have adjusted their pricing and decreased the price of some of their razors so that they are more aligned with the price of men&#8217;s razors and encourages other companies to follow suit; notes the Government&#8217;s failure to support the Gender-based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill 2017-19; and calls on the Government to end the discriminatory Pink Tax by supporting the forthcoming Private Members&#8217; Bill to be tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Bob Blackman</span><span class="signatory">Chris Law</span></p>
			<p>That this House is very concerned by the crackdown on peaceful protest and the media in The Gambia, following the use of excessive force by security forces last month to disperse protesters calling for President Adama Barrow to fulfil his pledge to step down after three years in power, resulting in many injuries and three deaths, as well as the closure of two FM radio stations and charges of incitement brought against at least two journalists; notes that despite some progress since the departure of former President Yahya Jammeh, allegedly responsible for forced disappearances, rape and murder during two decades of authoritarian rule, serious human rights violations still need to be addressed and accountability mechanisms strengthened; urges the Gambian Government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens, including by unconditionally releasing all those detained for exercising their right to peaceful protest, reopening radio stations it closed and releasing detained journalists; and calls on the Government, with the international community, to support the Gambian Government and civil society in the transition from dictatorship to democracy, as well as to engage with them under the auspices of the UK&#8217;s current Global Media Freedom campaign.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kenny MacAskill</span><span class="signatory">Steven Bonnar</span><span class="signatory">Chris Law</span><span class="signatory">Layla Moran</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Law</span><span class="signatory">Paul Girvan</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the valuable contribution that the haulage and logistics industry makes to the UK economy but understands that this contribution is being held back by an industry wide skills shortage and calls on the Government to reform the apprenticeships levy to support the industry and remove all barriers to ensure that the industry can tackle the skills shortage.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kate Hollern</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Law</span><span class="signatory">Paul Girvan</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the poor mental health, including feelings of depression and anxiety, experienced by nearly half of people after a bereavement as revealed in Sue Ryder&#8217;s recent survey; notes that this is partly a result of a lack of conversation in society around grief with a third of bereaved people feeling unable to talk openly about their loss; recognises the reluctance of people to start a conversation with someone who is bereaved with over half being scared they would say the wrong thing and nearly half not knowing what to say; commends Sue Ryder for launching the #JustSaySomething campaign; encourages people who have been bereaved to open up to their support network and ask for help from their GP if they need it, those supporting someone struggling with their grief to encourage conversation and be ready to listen and for people supporting those who are grieving to find tips on how to do this on the Sue Ryder website; and further recognises the role of public figures in society in facilitating and encouraging everyone dealing with bereavement to talk freely when they want to and to create as compassionate a society as possible.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the slow implementation of many areas of the Peace Accord in Colombia, including rural reform, crop substitution and victims&#8217; rights to justice which lie at the root of the conflict, as well as the often disproportionate use of force by officials in response to social protest; notes with alarm that areas vacated by the FARC have been filled by other illegal armed groups and militarised more generally, resulting in local populations being marginalised and threatened; urges the Colombian Government to comply with Resolution 1190/2018 of the Ministry of the Interior when addressing social protest, to seriously consider making the National Police accountable to civilian authorities rather than the Ministry of Defence, to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of on-going attacks and killings of social leaders and human rights defenders, and to implement all elements of the Peace Accord, as well as territorial development plans (PDETs); and calls on the Government to closely monitor spending by the Colombian Government of the UK&#8217;s funding for the implementation of the Peace Accord, to continue playing a key role on the UN Security Council on Colombia, including with the Verification Mission, whose mandate should be renewed for a further three years, and to continue supporting the Colombian Government and civil society in fully implementing the Peace Accord to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that community language services help provide young people with an understanding of their first language and culture, raise educational attainment, celebrate diversity and linguistic plurality, and promote social cohesion across communities; is concerned that, at a time when many are worried about knife crime, radicalisation and the lack of a sense of belonging that many young people feel, these services are being cut and privatised; regrets that local government and the vital public services they provide have been undermined by Government cuts, leading to the loss of key services, such as community language services; and calls on the Government to ensure that the local and public provision of community language services is free at the point of use.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the recent assessment of Transport Focus' National Rail Passenger Survey (NRPS) by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) found that the statistics have the potential to be misrepresented or used misleadingly; further notes that the annual NRPS results are used by the Department for Transport to inform the franchising process, and that further clarity on how this process operates is required for transparency; believes the NRPS methodology should be updated to ensure that it takes passengers' overall satisfaction with an operator into account, rather than measuring satisfaction with one journey only; further believes that it should better address issues around the accessibility of the railway, including engaging with disabled non-users of the railway and specifically asking passengers if they value the presence of station and on-train staff; and calls upon the Government and Transport Focus to meet relevant stakeholders, including trade unions and disability groups, to determine how the NPRS can be updated to more accurately reflect the view and requirements of passengers.</p>
