			<p>That this House welcomes news that Midlothian-based scientists have decoded the whole genetic make-up of pigs in a development that will facilitate the discovery of genetic variations linked to key traits; recognises that the study was led by scientists at the Roslin Institute and the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service Meat Animal Research Centre and involved 40 scientists from 15 laboratories in the UK and US; understands that the findings could help improve selective breeding and enable more accurate use of gene-editing technologies to develop pigs with desired characteristics, such as resistance to infectious diseases; further understands that knowledge of that genome also enables identification of genetic similarities between pigs and humans, which will enhance biomedical research in which pigs are used as models to study human health; and commends the Roslin Institute for its world-renowned innovation and hard work.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the widely acknowledged and continuing success of the Scottish Government’s public health measures in driving down coronavirus related infection and mortality rates; recognises the continuing need for responsible observation of behaviours that limit the spread of the virus and help keep everyone safe; pays tribute to the Scottish First Minister and her stated position that public health, not politics, must drive decisions on coronavirus strategy and her steadfast and determined commitment to protect the people she serves from a deadly virus. </p>
