			<p>That this House condemns the violent rhetoric used by US President Donald Trump in response to protests over the killing of George Floyd and racial injustice; urges the Government to express this strength of feeling in the strongest terms publicly and to their US counterparts; and calls on the Government to review exports to the US of equipment including tear gas, rubber bullets and riot shields immediately, amid reports that these are being used against civil rights protesters.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that teachers are working hard to ensure that children are sufficiently supplied with resources for home learning; notes that a large majority of these resources are online; is concerned that school children from disadvantaged social-economic backgrounds may not have access to computers, laptops, tablets or broadband; notes that pre-existing inequalities in access to educational resources have been exasperated due to this digital divide; acknowledges the current Government scheme which provides care leavers, children and young people aged 0 to 19 with a social worker and disadvantaged year 10 pupils with digital devices, and care leavers, young people aged 11 to 19 with a social worker and disadvantaged year 10 pupils with internet access provided through 4G hotspot devices; notes that this scheme does not go far enough; applauds the Welsh Government which is providing all school pupils that do not have their own internet-connected devices with school laptops and 4G mobile wifi; and calls on the Government to provide all school children across the UK who receive free school meals and any others in need with a laptop or tablet and broadband.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to extend the business rates holiday to local and regional newspapers in the UK; notes that business rates relief has been extended to the news media sector in Scotland by the Scottish Government; recognises that the media industry is under severe financial pressure due to the covid-19 outbreak; thanks local newspapers and media outlets for providing their communities with a vital service during the present crisis; further recognises that more than 2,000 staff in the national and regional press in the UK have temporarily lost their jobs as a result of the outbreak, according to the Press Gazette; further notes that circulation of paid for newspapers was down as much as 39 per cent in April 2020 compared to in March 2020; and further calls on the Government to recognise the importance of a diverse media industry for preserving our liberal democracy and take firm steps to save our media outlets.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	3/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p>That this House commends the Minister for Business, Energy, and Clean Growth&#8217;s decision to spread the distribution costs of electric energy to Shetland across the whole of the UK; acknowledges that both the telecoms and gas networks have dominant suppliers yet the distribution costs are shared equally by their customers across the UK; further acknowledges that households in the far north are paying disproportionately high distribution costs on electric energy; notes that no access to mains gas means that those living in the Highlands have no choice but to use electric energy which is more than three times more expensive than gas energy; notes that 90 per cent of households in Caithness and Sutherland are living in fuel poverty and are, as a result, often forced to choose between heating and eating during the winter months; calls on the Government to replace the current electricity distribution system with one that replicates that of gas and telecoms and share the cost of energy distribution equally across the UK.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">553</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Local access to energy grid</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	3/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p>That this House notes that SSE is the incumbent energy supplier to the far north; further notes that communities are unable to sell clean, renewable energy that they generate to local people; acknowledges that this is blocking the remarkable potential for new community energy companies to emerge across the country and is also negatively contributing to fuel poverty in rural constituencies such as the Highlands; notes that local energy businesses must sell any excess energy back to SSE before local people can purchase it back at 10 times the price that local energy businesses could have originally sold it to them for; notes that if local energy business could sell directly to local people then it would benefit consumers with cheaper electricity, the environment with more renewable energy schemes, investors and the local economy; and calls on the Government to institute the right to local supply which would make the cost of selling local energy proportionate to the scale of a local supplier&#8217;s business.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">554</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>World Environment Day 2020</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	3/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p>That this House celebrates World Environment Day on 5 June 2020; notes that it is time to recognise the nature emergency; calls for the UK to become carbon negative not neutral; notes that young people, given that they will have to carry the main burden, should be involved in the decision-making process for achieving that goal; calls for a Young Citizens&#8217; Assembly to be formed to make this a reality; acknowledges the part that biodiversity catastrophe plays in pandemics; recognises that to build resilience there needs to be talk about habitat as well as carbon; calls on the Government to implement green bailouts such as rescuing the car industry by incentivising electric vehicle purchases; further calls for a ban on new fossil fuel cars by 2030, taking such cars off the road completely by 2045, alongside the introduction of a green scrappage scheme to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles; further recognises that many people may be reluctant to use public transport after the covid-19 outbreak and that further encouragement for the use of electric vehicles will be needed; and calls on the Government to improve the use of subsidies for buyers of electric vehicles, bring in stricter regulation of Vehicle Excise Duty and company car taxation, invest in charging points and provide direct help to car companies.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Marion Fellows</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government action on axing the reading tax on e-books to bring the rate of VAT in line with print books; notes with concern that audiobooks still carry the full rate of VAT; believes that audiobooks are vital for millions of people in the UK with visual impairments, dyslexia or other reading disabilities and should not be treated as a luxury; notes that many European countries have recently adjusted their rates of VAT on audiobooks and e-books to bring them into line with the treatment of physical books; and calls on the Government to immediately review the VAT treatment of audiobooks and to bring forward legislation to remove VAT from audiobooks in a timely fashion.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kirsten Oswald</p>
			<p>That this House notes during Volunteers Week 2020, the outstanding work of community volunteers all over East Renfrewshire, acting with imagination and kindness to support their neighbours through the Corinavirus pandemic; notes the enthusiasm and good heart with which people signed up to volunteer drives covering streets and neighbourhoods; applauds the efforts of these groups of neighbours, supporting those living in their area with shopping, prescription collection and companionship; notes the generous efforts of religious congregations, sports clubs, and community councils in assisting those in need of support or solace locally; notes the helpful assistance of local businesses and charities in the community effort; appreciates the valuable work done by community organisations making joined up work on volunteering possible; acknowledges that people in East Renfrewshire have displayed friendship, care and compassion for one another as demonstrated by the imaginative and wide ranging volunteer activities and work; and pays tribute to everyone involved in this fantastic community effort in East Renfrewshire and all those working tirelessly to ensure the most vulnerable in the community are not left behind during these extremely challenging times.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that 17 May is the annual International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia and Interphobia to highlight the violence and discrimination that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex communities and other people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities or expressions, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) continue to face; further notes with concern that the covid-19 pandemic is increasing inequalities for many marginalised groups globally, including LGBT+ people particularly in the areas of access to healthcare, housing, employment as well as misuse of emergency powers and increase in hate crime and domestic abuse for those in lockdown; celebrates civil society defending LGBT+ rights around the world, including in the jurisdictions where LGBT+ identities remain criminalised; commends the UK&#8217;s role as co-chair of the intergovernmental Equal Rights Coalition which advocates for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people; maintains the importance of the UK&#8217;s role in promoting and protecting LGBT+ rights globally; and calls on the Government to continue to advance and uphold the rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kirsty Blackman</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain&#8217;s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as &#163;40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the high number of tenants who have lost income during the coronavirus crisis; further concerned about the number of tenants who are in rent arrears and are at risk of eviction as soon as the temporary freeze on evictions is lifted; notes that this crisis comes at a time when our housing system already prioritises the private profits of landlords over the rights of tenants; is concerned about reports of tenants being pressured into paying rent when that leaves them without enough money for food or other essentials; commends the work of tenant and community unions including ACORN, Living Rent and the London Renters Union in organising to protect communities during this crisis; calls on the Government to suspend rent immediately for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis, cancel rent arrears accrued during the crisis and protect renters from eviction so that no one loses their home while they are trying to cope with Coronavirus and its aftermath.</p>
