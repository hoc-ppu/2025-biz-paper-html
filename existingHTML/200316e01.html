			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the publication of Sir Amyas Morse&#8217;s Loan Charge review and the announcement that the Government will make some amendments to the relevant legislation; notes that loans made before 2010 will no longer be subject to the Loan Charge and that the self-assessment deadline has been delayed until 30 September 2020; believes that people should pay the tax that they owe, but that HMRC failed to work constructively with those seeking a Loan Charge repayment plan, with concerns that some may face bankruptcy or homelessness; demands HMRC review the implementation of this policy to ensure that nobody seeking to make repayment is treated unfairly with undeliverable financial demands; condemns the tax professionals who advised clients to use such loopholes given the importance of people paying their fair share for public services; and urges the Government to pursue the organisations that facilitated these loans.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kirsten Oswald</p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern that the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardising the work and income as well as the health of many people, including the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts; notes that the Government&#8217;s revised sick pay policy announced in the budget does not expand eligibility for statutory sick pay, and that an estimated 2 million workers would remain excluded and reliant on employment and support allowance or universal credit; further notes that these arrangements and the low level of sick pay, currently just &#163;94.25 per week, will expose many workers and their families to financial hardship and uncertainty; recognises the increased risk to public health this poses as people are forced to remain in the workforce on economic grounds even when this is contrary to public health or medical advice; further recognises the findings of research by the Institute for the Future of Work, which indicates that boosting the statutory floor of protection would support social and economic resilience; calls for emergency legislation to introduce statutory sick pay for all as a contribution to dealing with the worst public health crisis in a generation; and further calls on the Government to initiate cross-departmental work on a policy framework for socially responsible, human-centred employment, including a review of basic statutory protection for the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kirsten Oswald</p>
			<p>That this House remembers with great sadness that one year ago, on 15 March 2019, 51 people were murdered and many more had their lives changed forever by an act of extreme right terrorism in Christchurch, New Zealand; welcomes the report The Impact of Christchurch Terror Attack by TellMAMA, a national project which records and measures anti-Muslim incidents in the UK; notes that this extremely important and harrowing analysis of the events in Christchurch highlights that the attacks on the mosques in Christchurch had a significant effect in the UK, resulting in a rapid but long-lasting rise in anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia; recognises that the report makes challenging reading for the social media platforms who must now direct their immense resources towards ensuring the removal of unacceptable material from their sites and increased efforts to stop groups from promoting hatred and violence; further recognises that it shouldn't take a tragedy such as the events in Christchurch for society to notice how entrenched racism and islamophobia have become in society and that copycat attacks in the UK and elsewhere across the globe must be a wake-up call for all those committed to fighting hatred.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>
			<p>That this House commends the incredible work of teachers, parents and carers in supporting and nurturing children with Special Education Needs and Disabilities; recognises that children with Special Education Needs and Disabilities deserve equal opportunity to develop and flourish in our education system; further recognises the way individuals with Special Education Needs and Disabilities enrich schools and society as a whole; condemns the requirement on schools to fund the at least first &#163;6,000 of support for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities; recognises the injustice of making caring for children with Special Education Needs and Disabilities a financial burden on schools in the face of cuts to schools General Budgets; notes that this results in schools being unable to enrol or support children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities; calls on the government to end this injustice and provide schools with the funding for the entirety of the support needed by children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alex Davies-Jones</p>
			<p>That this House calls for an urgent review of the implementation of the 42-year-old Barnett Formula for funding devolved nations such as Wales; notes with concern that HM Treasury&#8217;s March 2020 budget does not consider an extra funding commitment to cover funds lost through the UK&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union; further notes the findings from the 2019 Public Accounts Committee report including the need for greater transparency over funding for devolved administrations with concern; acknowledges the achievements of the Welsh Government and its record of delivery of public services; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to make the devolution settlement more sustainable.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Deidre Brock</p>
			<p>That this House warmly congratulates the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) on its 350th anniversary; acknowledges that the gardens were founded in 1670; celebrates the rich history of the RBGE noting its beginnings as a small physic garden stocked with medicinal herbs, Scottish native plants, and novel varieties imported from abroad, to its standing today as one of the world&#8217;s top four botanic gardens enjoyed by a million visitors a year; recognises the RBGE as a centre for outstanding plant research and horticulture with an extensive educational and public engagement programme; and thanks those who have made the RGBE such a success over the centuries, including Regius Keeper, Simon Milne and his team of staff, students and volunteers who are taking the organisation from strength to strength.</p>

			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>
			<p>Below are EDMs tabled in the last two weeks to which names have been added. Only the first 6 names and any new names are included.</p>
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">260</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Equitable Life</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	5/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	19</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jonathan Edwards</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Green</span><span class="signatory">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the Equitable Life scandal remains an ongoing and significant injustice; notes that the majority of victims are retired factory shop workers, nurses, teachers, civil servants and small business owners who diligently saved for their retirement; is concerned that 12 years after the Government accepted the Parliamentary Ombudsman's findings that a decade of maladministration by UK Government regulators led to one million pension savers suffering multi-billion pound losses, 95 per cent of Equitable Life policyholders have received only 22 per cent of the money they lost as a consequence of UK Government maladministration; seeks a commitment that victims will receive the missing 78 per cent of their compensation entitlement; seeks a further commitment that the 10,000 pre-September 1992 WP annuitants are compensated on exactly the same terms as those who took their WP annuity after that date; and therefore calls on the Government to urgently increase the available funding from &#163;1.5 billion to &#163;4.1 billion to reflect the Treasury's own calculation of the true cost of full compensation to all victims.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wera Hobhouse</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mohammad Yasin</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Daisy Cooper</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the BBC is a national treasure, a public service the UK can be proud of, with world class programmes and services, that the public pay for; notes that whatever criticism there may be of the BBC&#8217;s news output, editorial decisions, governance, transparency, accountability and independence from government, public service broadcasting is a principle worth defending in its own right; further notes and condemns the Government&#8217;s recent briefing against the BBC, its threatened decriminalisation of the TV licence fee and the disastrous effect that that would have on UK public service broadcasting; notes the importance of the BBC for foreign diplomacy, the international respect it garners, and the global brand it offers in the context of the UK leaving the EU; is concerned about the rise of fake news, big data manipulation of democracies and other worrying technological trends that make it critical the UK public has access to a publicly accountable BBC that provides services which aim to inform, educate and build resilience to such dangerous trends; believes that the BBC positively influences the UK's media ecology through its high standards and investment in local, quality content; and further recognises the We Own It campaign backed by The New Weather Institute that calls for the BBC to stay a publicly-owned and funded public service broadcaster, a genuine and open process to make sure that the BBC has fair, sustainable funding for the long-term, and a BBC that enshrines greater transparency, accountability and independence to better serve the public in the 21st century.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates Commonwealth Day and the shared goals and bonds between Commonwealth nations, but regrets that half a million UK pensioners living overseas in so-called frozen countries, of which over 90 per cent are Commonwealth nations, are suffering unfairly because the value of their pension is frozen and not up-rated annually in line with inflation, plunging thousands of UK pensioners including veterans and former public servants into poverty; and calls on the Government to uprate the pensions of all UK pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">267</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Real fur imports</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alex Norris</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sammy Wilson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Hilary Benn</span></p>
			<p>That this House urges the Government to introduce legislation to ban the imports and sales of real fur products; notes that the UK has long banned the main methods of fur so-called production, namely leg-hold trapping and fur factory farming, due to their inherent cruelty; believes that, in view of these bans, it is hypocritical to continue to allow the import of real fur; further notes that the fur industry in the UK has significantly declined over the last 40 years, is now rejected by the majority of global fashion houses and UK high street retailers, and that fur sales are soon to be banned in California; acknowledges that there is a political and legal opportunity for a fur ban with the UK leaving the European Union; further acknowledges that there is widespread public support for a fur ban; and further believes that a fur ban is a natural extension of the existing import bans on cat and dog fur and commercial seal products, and that a comprehensive fur ban will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the promotion of animal welfare.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Gavin Robinson</span><span class="signatory">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</span></p>
			<p>That this House honours and recognises the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make; notes the particular sacrifices that the partners of veterans make and the consequences for them of tragically losing a spouse or partner serving in the armed forces; notes the changes announced in 2014 which allowed war widows or widowers that lost their spouse or cohabiting partner in service in the armed forces before 6 April 2005, and had not remarried by 1 April 2015, to retain their war widow pension for life regardless of ongoing relationship status; notes however that this regrettably excluded war widows bereaved before 6 April 2005 that had already had to surrender their war widows pension upon remarrying or cohabiting; believes that this is unacceptable; notes that the only way this group of war widows could regain their pensions is by divorcing their current partners and remarrying them; agrees with the then Defence Secretary who said on 18 February 2019 that this was a burning injustice, Official Report, column 1187; and therefore supports the campaign of the War Widows Association to rectify this anomaly; and urges the Government to correct this injustice by providing equalisation and compensation for the small number of war widows unjustly affected.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Wera Hobhouse</span><span class="signatory">Daisy Cooper</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the negative effect that the new points-based immigration system will have on&#160;care, particularly considering the 122,000 job vacancies in the social care sector identified by Skills for Care; recognises the invaluable contribution that migrants bring to the UK as carers, and that low paid work should not be equated with low skill level; emphasises the need for an evidence-based immigration policy; and calls on the Government to engage with the care sector to ensure that&#160;its concerns on the proposed points-based immigration system and its possible consequences are adequately addressed in full.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Bob Blackman</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement to allow employed parents of premature and sick babies to to claim up to 12 weeks Neonatal Leave and Pay; recognises the positive impact this will have for thousands of families every year; understands that over 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care every year leading to many parents using their maternity or paternity leave before getting them home; notes around 1 in 4 working men do not currently qualify for paternity leave; understands that this limits parental involvement in their baby's care despite this being essential for babies&#8217; to have the best developmental outcomes; notes having a baby in neonatal care has been shown to negatively affect parents&#8217; mental health with some studies reporting up to 40 per cent of mothers of preterm babies showing signs of post-natal depression compared to 10 per cent of mothers generally; further notes that neonatal care is expensive with parents reporting additional costs of over &#163;280 for every week their baby is in neonatal care at a time when their household income is reduced; and calls on the Government to introduce these welcome proposals swiftly with consideration for parents who do not currently qualify for parental leave rights due to being self-employed or a worker.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges that over 2,000 EU citizens living in Midlothian have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living and working in the UK; recognises the enormous contribution that EU citizens make to the cultural and economic fabric of the UK every day; further recognises Scotland&#8217;s particular reliance on EU citizens, with 26 per cent of small employers in Scotland having at least one EU citizen on the team compared to 21 per cent across the UK; notes with concern the risk that treating settlement in the UK as a privilege rather than a right could have on small businesses in Midlothian as a hub for small business; condemns the EU Settlement Scheme for treating settlement in the UK not as a right but a privilege; further condemns the Home Office for its lack of clarity in providing details of how many EU citizens have been granted settled status and pre-settled status; and recognises that the incompatibility between the Home Office&#8217;s approach to EU citizens and the needs of Scotland further underlines the need for Scotland to pursue an independent future with a more compassionate, open migration system.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that each year, thousands of animals including monkeys, mice, pigs and guinea pigs are experimented on using chemical, biological and other weapons, causing prolonged and extensive suffering; notes that while these experiments are not conducted to develop or test offensive weapons, suffering can continue for hours until the animal dies or is killed; further notes that examples of the symptoms of warfare experiments include bleeding genitals, writhing, substantial incapacitation, gasping, continuous tremor and visible production of saliva; highlights that the suffering is in addition to the standard deprivations of life in a laboratory that include restrictions on movement, inability to choose cage-mates and stress induced by human presence, light and sound; further notes that in 2018 at Porton Down, 1,941 animals were experimented upon for warfare experiments and that 30.2 per cent of those experiments  were classified as severe which resulted in the highest level of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm; and calls on the Government to introduce a ban on the use of live animals for warfare experiments.</p>

			<p>That this House urges the UK Government to immediately request an extension to the transition period and to suspend negotiations with the EU until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to 1 or 2 years; believes that public health professionals&#8217; advice for self-isolation will inevitably reduce the capacity of the Civil Service to negotiate a future agreement as well as its ability to replace European frameworks and agencies; recalls that the Prime Minister said in a statement on 12 March that there will be severe disruption across our country for many months; calls on the Government to minimise uncertainty for people and businesses during the outbreak; and further calls on the UK Government to work closely with other European governments in responding to the pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House marks the 32nd anniversary of one of the worst incidents of mass murder by chemical weapons when the town of Halabja in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq was attacked by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s war planes on 16 March 1988; notes that the use of chemical weapons caused agonising death, often in minutes, of 5,000 men, women and children as well as injuring over 10,000 and in many cases inflicting life-long and debilitating illnesses; further notes that the attack on Halabja was accompanied by a wider campaign of genocide known as the Anfal in which about 180,000 Kurds were murdered and thousands of villages razed to the ground in an act of destruction with continuing harm to the agricultural bedrock of the Kurdistan Region; applauds the decision in February 2013 of the UK parliament to formally recognise the Anfal genocide and the decision of the UK government to mark Anfal each year; believes that remembrance is vital not only to mark the memories of those who were murdered, many of whom have yet to be unearthed from so far hidden mass graves, but also to challenge the mentality in parts of Iraq towards the equality of the Kurds; and expresses its full solidarity with the Kurds in Iraq as they seek to overcome their tragic history and forge pluralism and prosperity in a pan-Iraqi context while being key allies in the continuing fight against extremism and bigotry.</p>
