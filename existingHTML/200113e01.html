			<p>That this House congratulates the celebrated Welsh singer-songwriter Dafydd Iwan on reaching number one in the iTunes UK song chart with his iconic anthem Yma o Hyd, thirty-seven years after it was first released; notes that Yma o Hyd celebrates the survival of the Welsh language and culture over the centuries, inspiring a resurgence in support for the language and culminating in three key Acts of Parliament including the Government of Wales Act 1998, which established the National Assembly for Wales; commends the Welsh independence movement Yes Cymru and their supporters for their successful campaign in getting Yma o Hyd to number one in the iTunes chart, beating contemporary artists such as Stormzy and Lewis Capaldi; and looks forward to the song&#8217;s new-found success further inspiring the enduring resilience of Welsh language and culture.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p>That this House is aware that the hormone pregnancy drug test, Primodos, was taken by approximately 1.5 million women in the 1960s and 1970s to test for pregnancy; understands that there is considerable evidence that many women who took this drug either gave birth to babies with serious deformities, miscarried, or had stillbirths, with the babies affected now in their 40s and 50s, having experienced a lifetime with serious disabilities; seeks answers as to why no official warnings were issued about this drug until eight years after the first major report that indicated possible dangers; is alarmed that some doctors were still prescribing this drug for pregnant women after official warnings were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines; has deep concerns about the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-led expert working group's review of this issue which seems to have been shrouded in secrecy; urges the UK Government to fully respond to concerns raised about the methodology of this review, the independence of the panel members, the conclusions of the report and the fact that key information seems to have been withheld from the report in order to suggest that there is no link between Primodos and birth defects; welcomes the announcement by the former Prime Minister in February 2018 of a review of this scandal involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos; and urges the current Prime Minister to ensure that a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter is established without delay, to ensure justice for those affected.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Virginia Crosbie</p>
			<p>That this House notes the importance of the Welsh language to the cultural identity of Wales and its residents; is aware of the importance of the teaching of the Welsh language in schools; believes that Government bodies should play their part in advancing the language; and calls on the Government to commit to consider carefully the impact of legislation on the protection of the Welsh language for future generations.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Blomfield</p>
			<p>That this House supports Young Carers Awareness Day, led by Carers Trust, which takes place on 30 January 2020; recognises the importance of young carers, who include as many as 1 in 5 children and young people in the UK; highlights the challenges faced by young carers and the negative impact their caring responsibilities can have on their education; acknowledges that research shows that young carers perform substantially less well than their peers at school; notes that compulsory education providers have an important role in identifying and supporting young carers; and calls on the Government to collect and publish information about the attendance, school achievement and well-being of young carers.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Debbie Abrahams</p>
			<p>That this House deplores the 77 per cent increase in the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation in England to 84,740 since 2010, including 126,020 children, with a further 82,000 children sofa surfing according to the Children&#8217;s Commissioner; is concerned that according to Crisis a further 3.74 million people would rather have a home of their own; condemns the increasing number of homeless individuals dying, including 726 in 2018 alone; recognises that a large proportion of homelessness is the result of cuts to housing benefit; notes that the increase in evictions is driven by insecure tenancies and exacerbated by court action, that temporary accommodation for some is lasting over ten years, and that the impact on the health and well-being of homeless people and their children can be very severe; and calls on the Government to support the Elimination of Homelessness Bill, urgently take steps to increase housing and council tax benefit as well as universal credit, and adequately fund local authorities to ensure that no property remains empty or unused for more than six months.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the growing body of evidence, including research reports by Doctors of the World, Maternity Action and the British Medical Association, that the NHS England overseas visitors charging regime is deterring vulnerable migrant women living in the UK from seeking essential maternity care; is further concerned that the MBRRACE-UK report, Saving Lives, Improving Mothers&#8217; Care 2019, published on 13 December 2019, links the charging regime and a possible fear of being charged to the deaths of three women who delayed seeking critical antenatal care in 2015-17; notes that the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Midwives have all urged ministers to suspend the charging regime pending a full independent review of its impact on individual and public health; further notes that less than 40 per cent of the total sum of charges levied in England in recent years has actually been recovered by the NHS; agrees with the stated view of the Royal College of Midwives that the Government has a duty to give the NHS the resources it needs and should not be using NHS clinicians to patrol our borders; and urges the Government to respond positively to Maternity Action&#8217;s call, supported by the Royal College of Midwives, for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the publication of the Online Harms White Paper in April 2019 and subsequent assurances by the Government that they will introduce a robust regulator to safeguard children online; further notes that over 45,000 people signed the NSPCC&#8217;s Wild West Web petition calling for statutory regulation so that social networks have a legal duty of care to protect every child from abuse online; and notes the urgent need for Government action as data obtained by the NSPCC shows that over the last year an average of 11 child sexual offences occurred each day over just three commonly-used social network platforms; notes that the Home Office estimates that 80,000 adults in the UK poses a sexual threat to children online; recognises that due to the pressing need for change and the time it would take to set up a new regulator that an interim regulator should be appointed to fill the regulatory gap while more long-term measures are being put in place; and calls on the Government to bring in legislation as promised to assign a duty of care regulator to keep children safe online as a matter of urgency, and, in the interim, to support Lord McNally's Private Member's Bill, introduced on 14 January 2020 into the House of Lords, which instructs Ofcom to start preparing for the new regime.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that while Highways England management are telling staff in pay band one to eight that they cannot have a pay rise above one per cent, that a Freedom of Information response has revealed a huge increase in senior grade staff earning above &#163;100,000 with a total of 63, the vast majority of whom are male, earning basic salaries in excess of &#163;100,000 and with a total pay bill of &#163;8,537,715; notes that Highways England's predecessor organisation, the Highways Agency, only paid six people salaries in excess of a &#163;100,000; further notes that when civil servants working for the Highways Agency were transferred from the civil service into Highways England, they were told that one of the benefits would be flexibility on pay, as they would no longer be subject to public sector pay caps; believes that these latest figures highlight that staff were grossly misled and that the only people benefiting from pay flexibility in Highways England are senior management; recommends that as Highways England is a Government-owned company of which the Transport Secretary is the sole shareholder, that the Government should intervene to ensure that the vast majority of Highways England staff are no longer subjected to one per cent pay rises; and further calls on management to negotiate a fair pay raise with trade unions and reward the hard-working staff with pay rises that meet the cost of living.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises World Cancer Day on 4 February 2020; welcomes a drive to improve cancer early detection rates; understands that radiotherapy is needed in 40% of cancer cures with one in four of the population needing radiotherapy at some point in their lives; notes the campaigning work of radiotherapy4life which has highlighted that the radiotherapy service is already in need of significant investment and more coherent commissioning; accepts that the need for such investment and improved commissioning will only increase as more cancers are detected earlier; and welcomes the updated Manifesto for Radiotherapy published by the all-party group on Radiotherapy which is calling for a proportion of the recently announced increased NHS funding to be invested in the radiotherapy service to provide a one-off &#163;250 million investment in satellite centres to allow local access, a further &#163;140 million to replace ageing radiotherapy machines and IT, and the additional increase of &#163;100 million in the annual budget to ensure the support and workforce required to make access to advance radiotherapy the norm, as well as a fully funded central rolling machine replacement programme, all supported by a new Tsar-like figure to ensure coherent commissioning and organisation.</p>

			<p>That this House notes this Government could be responsible for five of the remaining 11 years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned are left to halve global emissions and limit warming to 1.5C; further notes that the Committee on Climate Change report in July 2019 revealed the Government had delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to get on track to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets than net zero by 2050, and that the UK's climate credibility rested on decisive Government action over thesubsequent 18 months; considers therefore that this Parliament will be regarded as the Climate Parliament and must seize this opportunity to ensure adequate action is taken to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown; welcomes the fact that the UK will host the UN climate summit COP26 in December 2020; considers success at this summit means recognising the moral imperative of doing everything possible to keep temperature rise to 1.5C, and the vast human cost to people around the world, including the UK, from extreme weather, food insecurity, sea level rise, and other events exacerbated by the climate crisis; urges the Government therefore to make addressing the climate emergency the central priority for domestic policy-making across all departments and on the global stage; and calls on the Government to enact a comprehensive Green New Deal, including the release of necessary funding to allow local authorities to lead, to rapidly decarbonise the entire UK economy while creating a fair and just society.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that veterans are an asset to our society and deserve the best possible care and support; considers that those who have been injured in the service of the UK deserve the full value of their War Disablement Pension; notes that under the current system the War Disablement Pension is counted as income by the Department of Work and Pensions and can therefore lead to veterans being materially disadvantaged when claiming Employment Support Allowance; welcomes the Scottish Government's alteration of the rules to ensure that the War Disablement Pension is exempt from income assessments and that veterans therefore receive its full value; and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to follow suit and disregard the War Disablement Pension from means-testing.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the music industry to our economy and the work, talent and expertise of musicians from all four nations of the United Kingdom; acknowledges that musicians rely on touring and performing in the other 27 nations of the European Union to make a living; appreciates that touring can mean visits to multiple countries, often crossing borders on a daily basis with very little notice; supports calls for visa and customs rules post-Brexit that account for this unique of working; expresses support for, and solidarity with, the Musicians&#8217; Union and its members; and pledges support for an EU- wide live music touring passport that will last a minimum of two years, is free or at least affordable, covers all member states of the European Union, annuls the need for carnets and other permits and covers road crew and technicians.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government's public consultation on controls on the import and export of hunting trophies; notes the strong cross-party support for EDM 1829, Session 2017-19 and that 86 per cent of the British public support an end to trophy hunting; further notes that most UK trophy imports are of threatened species and that the number of trophy imports from captive-bred animals is growing; believes that trophy hunting has had devastating impacts on some wildlife populations and that the pursuit of animals with the largest tusks, horns, or antlers is resulting in artificial selection which imperils the survival of these species; further believes that trophy hunting fees rarely provide substantive funding for conservation or benefits to local communities; is strongly of the view that killing animals for trophies is indefensible and cruel and that it has no place in the modern world; urges policy-makers to work with stakeholders to support sustainable economic development that creates real prosperity for people through preserving our natural heritage; and calls on the Government to implement a comprehensive ban on trophy hunting imports and exports as quickly as possible, to consider an immediate moratorium, and to work with other Governments to help bring an end to trophy hunting.</p>
