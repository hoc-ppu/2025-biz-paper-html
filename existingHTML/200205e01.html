			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Steven Bonnar</span></p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the decision taken on 10 January 2020 by the United Nations Security Council to cut back essential humanitarian aid to Northern Syria, a decision which exposes four million people to the prospect of a devastating lack of basic daily food stuffs and medicines; is troubled that two of the four access points to Northern Syria for aid have been closed; notes that all aid will now have to cross through the border with Turkey or direct from Government held areas; further notes that the UN Secretary General has stated that the previous programme of aid to Northern Syria was essential; raises concerns that Kurdish people of Syria will be disproportionately affected because of the policies of the Turkish State towards the Kurdish areas, many of which are now under Turkish occupation; and calls for the United Nations Security Council to reverse this dangerous decision and for all parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, and to broker a negotiated settlement which protects the rights of all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that there are thousands of unaccompanied child refugees throughout Europe living in desperate circumstances; welcomes the Government&#8217;s statement that it will ensure unaccompanied children will continue to be able to come to the UK to join a relative; notes with concern the removal of that protection from the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2019-20; further notes that the removal of legal protections for separated child refugees may lead to more children undertaking dangerous journeys in order to be reunited with their families; and calls on the Government to enshrine its commitment in law to ensure the ongoing protection of those vulnerable children and their right to reunification with their families.</p>

			<p>That this House supports members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) employed by Interserve at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who will embark on a month of strike action throughout February 2020; notes that this dispute has been ongoing since March 2019 over issues including pay, trade union recognition, removal of working hours for cleaners and sick pay; further notes that the last strike ballot in October 2019 returned a 100 per cent vote in support of further strike action on an 82.5 per cent turnout; commends the efforts of PCS in their attempts throughout this dispute to seek resolution via the conciliator, ACAS, and their calls for urgent meetings with the employer and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs during the most recent ballot period; is concerned that treatment of staff employed by Interserve at the FCO has worsened in recent months, with those involved in the dispute excluded from festive activities and attempts being made by their employer to close their designated break room; notes that no worker takes the decision to go on strike lightly; and therefore calls on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to bring an end to this dispute and ensure all workers in Government are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

			<p>That this House supports GMB and Unison workers at Luton and Dunstable Hospital taking action against the outsourcing of non-clinical staff; notes that outsourcing in cleaning and catering risks not only higher rates of hospital-acquired infections but brings worse conditions for staff; further notes that the previous outsourced contract led to the creation of a three-tiered workforce that  has undermined the working conditions of staff; notes that Engie planned to cut wages for staff by 20 per cent, or &#163;2000 a year; urges managers at Luton and Dunstable Hospital to take the concerns of the public and hospital workers seriously and consider bringing services back in-house; and supports those workers fighting for better pay, better conditions and the benefits of keeping the NHS public.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights World Wetlands Day and the tremendous work that is carried out by the Wetlands Trust every day of the year; notes the importance of the fact that 40 per cent of all species live or breed in Wetlands and that peatlands store 30 per cent of land based carbon; and thanks all of those who tend to and enhance biodiversity and give the time and resources to make a real difference to the environment in this way.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights that it is Children's Mental Health Week as set up by children's mental health charity Place2Be; notes the purpose of this week is to shine a spotlight on the importance of children and young people's mental health; understands that this year's theme is Find your Brave; and encourages schools, churches and voluntary sector youth organisations to use this opportunity to talk with children and build relationships discussing the theme and that life is all about taking small brave steps every day, and to outline that bravery could be about sharing worries and asking for help when it is needed, or trying something new and making the right choices.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the Government has for over two decades failed women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of the changes that were made to their state pension age due to equalisation brought on by the Pensions Act 1995; regrets that the Government only began writing to women affected from 2009 onward; acknowledges that the Scottish National Party previously submitted a fully funded proposal to help women born in the 1950s that was rejected by the Government; believes the onus is now on the Government to remedy the injustices suffered by millions of women across the UK; and calls on the Government to oversee a full impact assessment, which takes into account the wide reaching effects of its policy, and to make a decision on the recompense that affected women will receive based on the findings of such an assessment.</p>
