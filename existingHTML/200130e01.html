			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the proposals by Bank of Scotland to close a number of branches, including the Loanhead Bank of Scotland in Midlothian; notes that the Loanhead branch is the only bank in Loanhead and is the nearest bank for the communities of Bilston, Damhead and Roslin; considers that Bank of Scotland has not taken fully into account the growing population in these communities; and calls on Bank of Scotland to reconsider this short sighted proposal.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens [R] </p>
			<p>That this House supports members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) employed by Interserve at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who will embark on a month of strike action throughout February; notes that this dispute has been ongoing since March 2019 over issues including pay, trade union recognition, removal of working hours for cleaners and sick pay; further notes that the last strike ballot in October returned a 100 per cent vote in support of further strike action on an 82.5 per cent turnout; commends the efforts of PCS in their attempts throughout this dispute to seek resolution via the conciliator, ACAS, and their calls for urgent meetings with the employer and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs during the most recent ballot period; is concerned that treatment of staff employed by Interserve at the FCO has worsened in recent months, with those involved in the dispute excluded from festive activities and attempts being made by their employer to close their designated break room; notes that no worker takes the decision to go on strike lightly, and therefore calls on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to bring an end to this dispute and ensure all workers in Government are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sarah Owen</p>
			<p>That this House supports GMB and Unison workers at Luton &amp; Dunstable Hospital taking action against the outsourcing of non-clinical staff; notes that outsourcing in cleaning and catering risks not only higher rates of hospital-acquired infections but brings worse conditions for staff; further notes that the previous outsourced contract led to the creation of a three-tiered workforce that  has undermined the working conditions of staff; further notes that Engie planned to cut wages for staff by 20 per cent, or &#163;2000 a year; urges managers at Luton &amp; Dunstable Hospital to take the concerns of the public and hospital workers seriously and consider bringing services back in-house; and supports those workers fighting for better pay, better conditions and the benefits of keeping the NHS public.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Sparta Trampoline Club SCIO based in Glasgow on winning the British Gymnastics National Club Award at a glittering awards ceremony in Telford on Saturday 25 January 2020; notes this award is well-deserved recognition of the club&#8217;s outstanding commitment throughout 2019 to bring the sport of trampolining, through their new 6,000sq ft centre, to as many as possible within the community, with a particular focus on improving the fitness and well-being of their members; congratulates the 25 coaches and 278 members on helping to deliver this success; praises the 21 gymnasts from the Sparta Club who qualified for the Scottish National Championships, seven of whom received medals at the event; further pays tribute to Sparta Trampoline Club SCIO for successfully winning the Sports Council for Glasgow&#8217;s Club of the Year in 2019; and wishes the club continued success in 2020 with their extensive plans to grow the club and enhance the range of services and facilities they have available.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mark Tami</p>
			<p>This House notes that a claimant of universal credit that is approaching state pension age may be subject to nine weeks without income between the end of universal credit and the first payment of the state pension if they are not eligible for pension credit; further notes that that period includes up to thirty days in which no benefit is payable and that the  final universal credit assessment period can be reduced and paid on a pro-rata basis; and calls on the Government to ensure that universal credit is payable up to the day before the state pension is paid, regardless of whether pension credit is subsequently payable.</p>

			<p>This House supports the growth of electric vehicle sales; notes that Government funded grants for electric cars have been running since 2011 and that battery electric vehicles now represent 1.6 per cent of new car sales in the UK; further notes that those grants are due to end in March 2020 and that when the Government grant for plug-in hybrid cars ended in April last year sales fell by 50 per cent; recognises that in 2020 carmakers do not need to sell electric vehicles in the UK market to meet their EU targets and that if the grant is removed, those companies would be incentivised to instead sell their vehicles where market conditions are easier and grants are available; further recognises the importance of those grants for public health and reaching net-zero emissions; and calls upon the Government to continue grants for electric cars in the March 2020 Budget for a further five years and to invest in charging infrastructure.</p>
