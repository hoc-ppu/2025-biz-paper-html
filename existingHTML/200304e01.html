			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK&#8217;s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering &#163;100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the pressures on HMRC arising from the UK&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU, including the possibility of greater variation in customs and tariff arrangements, makes it imperative that retention of staff expertise is prioritised; further notes that the proximity of HMRC&#8217;s Ealing office to Heathrow airport makes it a strategically important location in allowing tax officers to link up with Border Force officials; regrets that management proposals to close the Ealing office will result in the loss of many highly-qualified and experienced members of staff who are unable to relocate to the new Regional Hub in Stratford; offers support and solidarity to members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union taking industrial action to protest at the planned closure; and therefore calls on HMRC management to suspend the existing plan to close the site and seek agreement over alternative arrangements.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that Six Nations organisers have refused to rule out the possibility of the tournament going behind a &#163;300 million pay per view paywall in 2022 following the start of a new broadcast rights period; believes that by ruling out joint bids by terrestrial broadcasters Six Nations officials are making it inevitable that the rights to broadcast the tournament will be secured by a pay-to-view subscription service; is concerned that this move risks losing an audience that has been built up and will stymie the ability of the sport to attract young players to the game; notes that the Six Nations tournament has a long tradition of being aired on free-to-view television in the UK and that any decision that would limit access would be a retrograde step; calls on the Six Nations organisers to reconsider their decision on allowing joint broadcaster bids; and further calls on the Government to ensure that the long-cherished Six Nations tournament is given full protection under Group A listed event status.</p>
