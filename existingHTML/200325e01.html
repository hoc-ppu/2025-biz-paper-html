			<p>That this House recognises the hard work and dedication of convenience store owners and their staff during the covid-19 health crisis; recognises the vital role that those store owners and staff play in their local communities in ensuring the supply of food and essential household items; notes that such shops develop important relationships with their customers and help look after people in their communities; and commends the many shops that have been quick to respond to the crisis by helping their older and vulnerable customers by providing essential items and volunteering to deliver shopping to customers in high-risk groups and to people who are self-isolating.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">324</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Closure of call centre sites during the covid-19 outbreak</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	25/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alex Sobel</p>
			<p>That this House notes concerns expressed by call centre staff who are being asked to physically attend work despite the Government's covid-19 advice to stay at home; believes that such demands are in breach of the national covid-19 guidance as much of that work is not essential and all that work can be carried out remotely; asserts that the continuation of physical call centre operations where staff sit less than half a metre apart poses a serious risk to public health during this ongoing health crisis; calls on the Government to issue clear guidance on who does and does not qualify as a key worker, how social distancing should be enforced between key workers and to advise that all call centre operations should be carried out remotely; and further calls on the Government to ask call centre industry leaders why they have not addressed those issues.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">325</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>NICE Guidelines on covid-19</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	25/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alex Sobel</p>
			<p>That this House notes that on 23 March 2020 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence introduced new guideline, NG 159; is concerned that the NICE guidelines for covid treatment state that people who need help with personal care will get a rank of 7, and only those in ranks 1 to 5 will receive critical care, meaning that otherwise healthy young people who need help with personal care owing to physical or cognitive disabilities would not be admitted if they needed critical care; and calls on the Government to ensure NICE revise the guidelines with disabled people and their carers in mind.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">326</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Protection of UK charities and third sector organisations</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	25/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Barry Sheerman</p>
			<p>That this House has considered the invaluable role that charity and third-sector organisations play in supporting vulnerable people and communities across the UK; recognises the immense strain placed on the sector by restrictions caused by the covid-19 outbreak; urges the Government to consider the need for a sector-wide bailout for charities to ensure their continued operation in the long-term in spite of pressures brought about by covid-19 restrictions; and commends those in the sector for their hard work and commitment in the face of sector-wide hardship.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">327</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Statutory Sick Pay</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	25/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wes Streeting</p>
			<p>That this House notes that the Secretary of State for Health told the BBC Question Time programme that he could not live on Statutory Sick Pay of &#163;94.25 week; believes that no worker should be expected to live on statutory sick pay of that level; and calls upon the Government to increase statutory sick pay to a liveable level immediately.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">328</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>VAT on energy bills</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	25/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	5</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Edward Davey</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">David Linden</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sarah Olney</p>
			<p>That this House commends the Government&#8217;s implementation of a VAT referral for businesses during the covid-19 outbreak; further commends the Government for ensuring that energy suppliers offer funding support for people who are unable to top up their meters, which has helped more than four million people; notes that, due to self-isolation orders given by the Government, the cost of energy bills and products are likely to dramatically increase; further notes that uSwitch estimates that self-isolating could increase energy bills by &#163;195 a year for people on poor-value deals; notes that many people on low incomes have been made redundant and will struggle to find alternative employment as the outbreak worsens; and calls on the Government to implement a VAT moratorium on energy bills and products.</p>
			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>
			<p>Below are EDMs tabled in the last two weeks to which names have been added. Only the first 6 names and any new names are included.</p>
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">288</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>EU Settlement Scheme and EU citizens in Midlothian</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	12/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	9</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Martyn Day</span></p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges that over 2,000 EU citizens living in Midlothian have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living and working in the UK; recognises the enormous contribution that EU citizens make to the cultural and economic fabric of the UK every day; further recognises Scotland&#8217;s particular reliance on EU citizens, with 26 per cent of small employers in Scotland having at least one EU citizen on the team compared to 21 per cent across the UK; notes with concern the risk that treating settlement in the UK as a privilege rather than a right could have on small businesses in Midlothian as a hub for small business; condemns the EU Settlement Scheme for treating settlement in the UK not as a right but a privilege; further condemns the Home Office for its lack of clarity in providing details of how many EU citizens have been granted settled status and pre-settled status; and recognises that the incompatibility between the Home Office&#8217;s approach to EU citizens and the needs of Scotland further underlines the need for Scotland to pursue an independent future with a more compassionate, open migration system.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">293</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Dame Carol Black's independent review of drugs</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mary Glindon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rachel Hopkins</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ronnie Cowan</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the importance of Professor Dame Carol Black's informative and insightful Independent Review of Drugs; notes that her research reveals that while the cost to society of illegal drugs is estimated at &#163;20 billion per year, only &#163;600 million is spent on treatment and prevention; further notes that her analysis confirms that problem drug use is highly connected to poverty and that those problems blight our most deprived communities; believes that problem drug use has reached the level of a public health emergency; and calls on the Government to tackle the disinvestment highlighted by the Review by reversing the cuts to drug treatment that have exacerbated this tragic situation.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">296</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Sir Amyas Morse's review of the Loan Charge</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Alison Thewliss</span><span class="signatory">John Nicolson</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the publication of Sir Amyas Morse&#8217;s Loan Charge review and the announcement that the Government will make some amendments to the relevant legislation; notes that loans made before 2010 will no longer be subject to the Loan Charge and that the self-assessment deadline has been delayed until 30 September 2020; believes that people should pay the tax that they owe, but that HMRC failed to work constructively with those seeking a Loan Charge repayment plan, with concerns that some may face bankruptcy or homelessness; demands HMRC review the implementation of this policy to ensure that nobody seeking to make repayment is treated unfairly with undeliverable financial demands; condemns the tax professionals who advised clients to use such loopholes given the importance of people paying their fair share for public services; and urges the Government to pursue the organisations that facilitated these loans.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">297</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Sick pay and the Institute for the Future of Work</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	12</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Allan Dorans</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Martin Docherty-Hughes</span></p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern that the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardising the work and income as well as the health of many people, including the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts; notes that the Government&#8217;s revised sick pay policy announced in the budget does not expand eligibility for statutory sick pay, and that an estimated 2 million workers would remain excluded and reliant on employment and support allowance or universal credit; further notes that these arrangements and the low level of sick pay, currently just &#163;94.25 per week, will expose many workers and their families to financial hardship and uncertainty; recognises the increased risk to public health this poses as people are forced to remain in the workforce on economic grounds even when this is contrary to public health or medical advice; further recognises the findings of research by the Institute for the Future of Work, which indicates that boosting the statutory floor of protection would support social and economic resilience; calls for emergency legislation to introduce statutory sick pay for all as a contribution to dealing with the worst public health crisis in a generation; and further calls on the Government to initiate cross-departmental work on a policy framework for socially responsible, human-centred employment, including a review of basic statutory protection for the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Alison Thewliss</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the severity of the current coronavirus outbreak and its impact on health and social care services across the UK; notes that in Scotland, there are approximately 157,000 NHS staff for a population of 5,295,400; further notes that there are over 300 hospitals in Scotland; acknowledges the immense pressure that doctors, nurses and support staff working in Scotland&#8217;s NHS may face over the next few weeks or months in urban and remote areas alike; recognises the personal risk they are undertaking in carrying out their roles; and expresses its immense thanks and gratitude to these staff members for the work they are doing and will do during these difficult times.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that there is an urgent need for national action to stave off food insecurity during the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take the following steps to deal with food insecurity: to provide immediate support to all voluntary and mutual-aid organisations currently working to tackle food insecurity in their communities as the private sector has shown itself unable to distribute food in a time of crisis, and thus mutual aid networks have rapidly grown to distribute the resources needed to ensure that communities are effectively supported in the coming weeks; to maximise capacity and stimulate food distribution and essential aid by reducing barriers to accessing food; to grant emergency resources to community support groups to ensure they are funded immediately and maintain their momentum and organisation over the coming weeks; and to protect community spaces during the pandemic and increase access to community and publicly owned kitchen facilities and unused spaces by freezing all rent and bills and making them available for use by community organisations in the distribution of food and resources.</p>

			<p>This House expresses concern at reports that some retailers are inflating the prices of products in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak; notes that the Competition and Markets Authority has urged businesses to behave responsibly and not increase prices in response to the covid-19 crisis; applauds the actions of retailers who have not inflated prices and those that have proactively taken measures to support their customers and local community at this difficult time; believes that while many businesses are striving to do the right thing under very challenging circumstances, the continued behaviour of those seeking to capitalise on the current situation by charging unjustifiably high prices for essential goods is immoral and unjust; and urges the Government to take action to price rises as a matter of urgency.</p>
