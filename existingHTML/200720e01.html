			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Law</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that students with disabilities face a financial barrier when accessing assistive technology and other miscellaneous equipment as a result of the &#163;200 minimum contribution required from the Disabled Students Allowance; notes that the implication of that cost is likely to be magnified as a result of the transition to e-learning following the covid-19 outbreak; calls on the Government to acknowledge the effect of that barrier on accessing higher education and on social mobility, and further calls on the Government to implement alternative mechanisms to ensure that a lack of finance is no longer a significant barrier to inclusive education opportunities for students with disabilities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Apsana Begum</p>
			<p>This House expresses its concern at the number of covid-19 cases in Bangladesh; recognises the efforts being made in Bangladesh to find a vaccine to the virus; notes that a study from Public Health England has found that those of Bangladeshi heritage are twice as likely to die from covid-19 as those of white British ethnicity, highlighting that Government policy in the UK and abroad must reflect the unequal impact that the virus has across BAME communities; and calls on the Government to support the tackling of covid-19 in Bangladesh in every way possible.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">741</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Hearing loops</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	20/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p>That this House notes the important and liberating effect of hearing loops on hearing-impaired people, allowing them to participate in public events and meetings; agrees that too few venues have hearing loops, which is in breach of the obligations set out in the Equality Act 2010; acknowledges the negative impact of a lack of hearing loops on the confidence of people who have impaired hearing; commends the Institute of Sound &amp; Communications Engineers for their Hearing Loop Assessment Scheme, aimed at evaluating and improving poorly-installed hearing loop systems; recognises the importance of venues being accessible to all people with disabilities so that there is a more inclusive society; and calls on the Government to ensure that organisations meet their obligations through the Equality Act 2010 so that people with a hearing impairment can be reconnected to important public matters;</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	20/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paula Barker</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the extraordinary commitment and sacrifice of NHS staff throughout the covid-19 outbreak; believes that the depth of public gratitude for this work must now be reflected in what the Government does next for NHS staff; notes that as it stands, NHS staff must wait until 2021 for their next pay rise despite having gone above and beyond during the covid-19 outbreak; recognises the importance of improving pay to tackle the vacancies that exist across all parts of the NHS workforce; and calls on the Government to show its support for the NHS by turning warm words and applause into a firm commitment to bring forward NHS pay talks and to fund an early and meaningful pay rise.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">743</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Funding for universities</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	20/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to provide vital funding for universities that are under mass financial strain; notes this is not an unexpected side effect from the covid-19 outbreak, but that the outbreak has worsened pre-existing problems resulting from a lack of financial Government support of higher education and the marketisation of education; further notes that thirteen universities, as found by the ISF, will face bankruptcy without a Government bail-out; recognises that SOAS University, the only higher education institution in the UK specialising in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, is currently facing a mass restructuring as a result of long term financial strain that has worsened with the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take action to provide essential support for those institutions.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">744</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Construction suppliers</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir George Howarth</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paula Barker</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Byrne</p>
			<p>That this House notes with great concern that orders to supply materials and products to housing associations, local authorities and other public services have in many cases, been put on hold; further notes that many of those suppliers still have high numbers of their workers on the Government&#8217;s furlough scheme as a consequence of the lack of orders and are having to consider substantially downsizing their business and the size of their workforce, which would lead to a national loss of construction supply capacity once the furlough scheme ends; and calls on the Government to hold urgent talks with housing associations, local authorities and other public bodies to encourage them to bring forward orders.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">745</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Pentlands Hills Fundraising for Borders General Hospital</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates six year-old Hamish King from Howgate, Midlothian, on climbing six Pentlands hills with his mother Sarah King and grandfather Willie Munro in order to raise money for the Borders General Hospital; notes that Hamish aimed to raise &#163;100 but has now raised more than &#163;1,265; understands that Hamish was inspired to raise money in this way by seeing other children raise money for the NHS on the news; and therefore notes how kindness often inspires further kindness and strengthens our societal bonds.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the urgent reversal of the decision to make over-75s pay for TV licences during the covid-19 outbreak; notes with concern that licenses will have to be paid for from August 2020; believes that responsibility for funding free TV licences should not have been handed over by the Government to the BBC; highlights that loneliness amongst the over 75s has worsened as a result of the covid-19 outbreak; further highlights that stripping the over-75s of their free TV licenses will exacerbate loneliness; and calls on the Government to reconsider the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Byrne</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Apsana Begum</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the clear and unambiguous ruling of the Lord Chief Justice in the case of journalists Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney, whose arrests for their role in making the award-winning documentary No Stone Unturned about the Loughinsland massacre were judge to be unlawful; notes that the arrests were carried out by Durham Constabulary at the behest of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on warrants issued outside the correct legal framework;  further welcomes the recent unreserved apology made to the two journalists by the PSNI, which committed to reviewing the legal judgement to learn all appropriate lessons;  believes that not only were the unlawful arrests a cause of distress, the position of the police since the illegal detentions has had a devastating impact on those two NUJ members; notes that the PSNI still retains a vast amount of journalistic material despite the issue of the court order; calls on the Chief Constable to demonstrate the sincerity of the apology by bringing to an end this shameful episode by arranging the immediate return of all material seized or copied; and further calls on the PSNI to act on the information contained in No Stone Unturrned to ensure that justice is delivered for the families of the Loughinisland victims.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the invaluable role of foreign nationals working in the health and social care sector on the frontline of the covid-19 outbreak; applauds their brave and unwavering hard work in the face of such unprecedented and difficult circumstances to ensure people get the care they need; notes that the Government&#8217;s announcement of a one-year visa extension excludes many of those working on the frontline, including cleaners and social care workers; further notes foreign nationals eligible for that extension will still need to renew their visa next year at an approximate cost of &#163;700 or leave the country; believes that those measures do not go far enough and that those people who have put their lives at risk for the country should be welcome to live in it; further believes that the only meaningful way to recognise and celebrate the contributions of foreign nationals working in the health and social care sector is to grant them indefinite leave to remain; and calls on the Government to grant indefinite leave to remain in the UK to all foreign nationals currently working in health and social care, and to their families.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Robert Halfon</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the distinct difficulties faced by deaf people during the covid-19 outbreak; notes that the Government guidelines advising that face coverings should be worn in certain public places poses a particular challenge to the deaf community, many of whom depend upon lip reading and facial expressions for communication; further recognises the anxieties this will bring for those vulnerable individuals and the added strain caused in carrying out daily tasks such as shopping; acknowledges that the use of visors by customer service staff would solve the problem for many deaf people; and calls upon the Government to work to accommodate the needs of the deaf community in its social distancing and covid-19 safety guidance.</p>

			<p>This House notes with grave concern the investigation by Eastern Eye newspaper into allegations of discrimination against and harassment of BAME judges by other members of the judiciary; expresses concern that no member of either the Judicial Executive Board or the Judges Council that advises the Lord Chancellor has any members from a black and minority ethnic background; and urges the Secretary of State for Justice and the Lord Chancellor to initiate an independent investigation into those matters.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the World Intellectual Property Organisation&#8217;s Beijing Treaty on Audio-Visual Performances which came into force on 28 April 2020; notes that the aim of that Treaty is to extend the economic and moral rights of actors and performers in audio-visual performances including films, videos and television programs; is concerned that not all signatories who have ratified that Treaty have done so in ways that are consistent with that aim; recognises the importance of the audio-visual industry to the UK economy and the integral role played by audio-visual performers who enrich our daily lives with their craft; considers that ratifying the Treaty in such a way as to allow for the economic and moral rights of actors and performers to be immediately transferred to the producer undermines a performer&#8217;s remuneration right; understands the importance of the concept of national treatment to secure revenues from usage of work in other countries; calls on the Government to enable an early ratification of the Beijing Treaty in line with that Treaty&#8217;s clearly stated aims; and further calls on the Government to undertake early talks with secondary users to ensure a fair and affordable system for upholding performers&#8217; rights.</p>

			<p>That this House is appalled by the behaviour of the tiny British Association of Journalists (BAJ), which is not affiliated to the TUC and has no international trade union connection, in reaching a wholly unethical and unprincipled sweetheart deal with the management of Iran International; believes that this move was a deliberate attempt to undermine the rights of minority ethnic workers seeking formal recognition of the National Union of Journalists, whose case is active with ACAS; notes that previously there were no known BAJ members or presence at the company, but understands there is now a single BAJ representative, a senior manager appointed by the union and management, and staff are now being put under pressure to join the union; and supports NUJ members at Iran International, NUJ chapels and branches nationwide, the TUC and wider trade union movement and in offering solidarity in their efforts to secure democratic and independent trade union representation.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that at this time when all parts of the United Kingdom have come together to fight COVID 19 and to support front line key workers when our country needs the NHS more than ever to be free at the point of delivery, Members of both Houses need to come together to support an end to car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England; recognises that the NHS was established to be free at the point of access; contends that extortionate car parking charges mean that the NHS is not free at the point of access for people with cars; further recognises that the charges are not only unfair for patients and their visitors but for hardworking NHS staff; realises that this is a clear injustice; and therefore urges the Government to scrap car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England and calls on all the devolved Administrations to do the same.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to discontinue the ability of elected MPs to participate remotely in parliamentary debates, bill committees and by electronic voting is unlawful and discriminatory because it means that up to 250 elected MPs, who are clinically shielded to protect themselves or their families from coronavirus, are no longer able to participate in these activities; further believes that the House of Commons is not empowered to remove the source of its own legitimacy and that the vote to do so was illegal as it excluded the elected MPs affected; calls for the restoration of the democratic rights of all elected MPs who are shielding, and of the constituencies and 15.5 million voters that they represent, to fully participate and for the resumption of virtual arrangements previously in place that continue in the House of Lords, the Senedd and Holyrood; and calls on the Leader of the House of Commons to reinstate the motion allowing online inclusion for shielded elected MPs in all debates and votes, including those on the legal and democratic rights of those elected MPs most affected by the removal of hybrid arrangements; further calls for the resumption of elected MPs&#8217; equal right to work in all aspects of their job, without unreasonable risk to their personal safety, by using the technology available and for the full restoration, without delay, of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament.</p>
