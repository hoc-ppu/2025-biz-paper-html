			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mohammad Yasin</span><span class="signatory">Sir Mark Hendrick</span><span class="signatory">Wera Hobhouse</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that the Mental Health Act will be reformed; agrees that current legislation is out of step with a modern mental healthcare system and that people must have a service that affords them the dignity and respect that they deserve; further notes that the announcement made no mention of the urgent needs of children; contends that unless their needs are embedded into a new Mental Health Act as a central priority such legislation will be fundamentally flawed; calls on the Government to guarantee that new mental health legislation will focus on children&#8217;s needs and protect them, ensure that services are provided by a properly qualified workforce and reflect policies that are informed by the best available evidence; and further calls on the Government to focus on the needs of parents and carers and guarantee to bring forward such legislative proprosals at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the impact of gambling addiction which can completely destroy the lives of the person addicted and has a huge impact on their family and those close to them; acknowledges the voluntary ban on gambling adverts during live sport before 9pm; and calls on the Government to go further and ban gambling adverts on TV and the internet outright, with the exception of the National Lottery and charitable lotteries.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the positive interventions from many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions; welcomes the equalisation of retirement ages between women and men; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory employment and pension laws; recognises that this included being excluded from some pensions schemes; recognises that this had the negative effect for them of losing the opportunity to have the same level of pension as their partner or spouse; further recognises that this has had the consequence of women in this position never being able to have equal pensions to men; further notes that this has negatively and profoundly impacted on them including increased poverty, deteriorating health and homelessness; notes that at least 3.8 million women have been impacted by the loss of their pensions from the age of 60 in three separate age hikes; and calls on the Government to enact a temporary special measure as permitted by international law to provide restitution to women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions from the age of 60 because of the impact of the rise in retirement age.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jeff Smith</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir Mark Hendrick</span><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that strategic rail infrastructure is critical to the long-term success of the UK and all of its parts; believes that after decades of under-investment in strategic rail infrastructure High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and Midlands Engine Rail delivered in full represent a once in a generation chance to transform connectivity, attract investment, boost skills and opportunity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands and will benefit the rest of the UK; further believes that transforming rail capacity and connectivity in the North and Midlands will create economic growth, improve productivity, boost jobs and skills, increase prosperity and support a transition to a low-carbon economy; and calls on the Government to deliver High Speed 2 in full and recognise this once in a generation opportunity to transform rail capacity and connectivity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">86</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Statutory minimum wage rates</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	20/01/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	19</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Amy Callaghan</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kirsten Oswald</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Grahame Morris</span></p>
			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around &#163;10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to &#163;10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid &#163;728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of &#163;9.30 per hour (&#163;10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">90</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Kashmiri people</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mohammad Yasin</span></p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to use all diplomatic and economic measures at its disposal to influence the Indian and Pakistan Governments to ensure that democracy is respected and that the Kashmiri people are at the heart of any constitutional reform of the region, including respecting both the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, particularly UNSCR 47 which refers to the people of Jammu and Kashmir having the right to self-determination and the 1972 Simla Agreement which refers to the future of Jammu and Kashmir being determined by peaceful means; and urges the Government to use all international fora to press for the rule of law in Kashmir to be upheld and human rights protected by lifting the telecommunications black out and allowing independent, international observers to the region as well as supporting the assistance of a UN Special Envoy for Kashmir in facilitating a peaceful and sustainable future for Kashmir.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mohammad Yasin</span><span class="signatory">Grahame Morris</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates that over 17,000 students at UK universities studied or worked abroad through the Erasmus+ programme in 2017-18, as well as thousands of school pupils, college students, apprentices, adult learners and teachers who took part in projects to study, work or train abroad, build international partnerships and share best practice; recognises that Erasmus+ has made studying abroad attractive and affordable by providing financial assistance to students who take part; highlights that the benefits of studying or working abroad include increased employability and the opportunities to learn a new language, fall in love with another country&#8217;s culture, build new friendships and act as ambassadors for the UK overseas; notes that the EU intends to expand Erasmus+ from 2021, with MEPs voting in March 2019 both to triple its budget for 2021-27 compared to 2014-20, and to place greater emphasis on widening access to study abroad opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; recalls the conclusions of the House of Lords European Union Committee&#8217;s 28th Report of Session 2017-19 that a replacement UK-led student mobility scheme would find it impossible to replicate aspects of Erasmus which are key to facilitating international exchanges, namely, the programme&#8217;s strong brand, trusted reputation, common rulebook and framework for partnership agreements, and its established network of potential partners; and accordingly calls on the Government to follow the Committee&#8217;s recommendation to seek full association to the 2021-27 Erasmus programme.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the establishment of a Tamil Heritage Month which would provide an annual opportunity to celebrate the contribution of the Tamil diaspora in the UK; notes that Canada holds a similar, highly successful Tamil Heritage Month; recognises that there are more than 300,000 Tamils living in the UK contributing substantially to the betterment of our economy and country; further notes the richness of Tamil culture; and recognises the benefits of such a month for raising awareness and understanding of the Tamil Community in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House is alarmed at the shocking news from Jaguar Land Rover that 500 jobs are to go at its Halewood plant as it moves from a three shift system to a two shift system; notes that there will be a knock on effect in the supply chain; is concerned that ongoing uncertainty about Brexit and our future trading relationships with the EU will mean that there are more job losses to come in the North West auto industry; and calls on the Government to provide support to ensure the ongoing viability of the North West car manufacturing industry during this period of uncertainty.</p>
