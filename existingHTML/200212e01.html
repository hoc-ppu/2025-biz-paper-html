			<p>This House deplores the Government's ongoing use of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries against the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review; notes that while the publication of the Review has been much delayed without explanation, it is expected to recommend the cessation of all deportations of people who have lived in the UK since childhood; notes that the Government has sought to justify recent deportations on the basis of the serious nature of the offences perpetrated by deportees, where this is not borne out in many cases; believes that where deportations are enforced on Foreign National Offenders who have served their sentences, this amounts to double punishment on arbitrary grounds; further believes that long-term residents should be rehabilitated in an equal fashion to their British-passport-holding peers; fears that the characterisation of all deportees as serious criminals exacerbates anti-migrant sentiment, increases racial tensions and exposes those deported to greater risk upon return; remains concerned that the Government's approach demonstrates a failure to appreciate the significant damage to trust in immigration enforcement that the Windrush Scandal represented; and calls on the Government to immediately suspend all deportations of residents who have been in the UK since childhood, and to publish and implement in full recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the poor mental health, including feelings of depression and anxiety, experienced by nearly half of people after a bereavement as revealed in Sue Ryder&#8217;s recent survey; notes that this is partly a result of a lack of conversation in society around grief with a third of bereaved people feeling unable to talk openly about their loss; recognises the reluctance of people to start a conversation with someone who is bereaved with over half being scared they would say the wrong thing and nearly half not knowing what to say; commends Sue Ryder for launching the #JustSaySomething campaign; encourages people who have been bereaved to open up to their support network and ask for help from their GP if they need it, those supporting someone struggling with their grief to encourage conversation and be ready to listen and for people supporting those who are grieving to find tips on how to do this on the Sue Ryder website; and further recognises the role of public figures in society in facilitating and encouraging everyone dealing with bereavement to talk freely when they want to and to create as compassionate a society as possible.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the slow implementation of many areas of the Peace Accord in Colombia, including rural reform, crop substitution and victims&#8217; rights to justice which lie at the root of the conflict, as well as the often disproportionate use of force by officials in response to social protest; notes with alarm that areas vacated by the FARC have been filled by other illegal armed groups and militarised more generally, resulting in local populations being marginalised and threatened; urges the Colombian Government to comply with Resolution 1190/2018 of the Ministry of the Interior when addressing social protest, to seriously consider making the National Police accountable to civilian authorities rather than the Ministry of Defence, to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of on-going attacks and killings of social leaders and human rights defenders, and to implement all elements of the Peace Accord, as well as territorial development plans (PDETs); and calls on the Government to closely monitor spending by the Colombian Government of the UK&#8217;s funding for the implementation of the Peace Accord, to continue playing a key role on the UN Security Council on Colombia, including with the Verification Mission, whose mandate should be renewed for a further three years, and to continue supporting the Colombian Government and civil society in fully implementing the Peace Accord to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>

Member for West Dorset; further welcomes the Government&#8217;s indication that it intends to adequately reflect the violent nature of animal cruelty crimes by backing this Bill; calls on the Government to also urgently amend the Animal Welfare Act 2006 so that extended maximum sentences for animal cruelty do not only apply to owners and keepers and can instead also be used in cases such as that of the Brighton cat killer.</p>
