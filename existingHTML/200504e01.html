			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Catherine McKinnell</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the valuable support provided to vulnerable and disadvantaged pupils during the covid-19 pandemic by the provision of free school meal vouchers; recognises the difficulties schools and parents are facing due to problems with the Edenred system in the provision of the vouchers; and calls on the Government to urgently address those difficulties by working with Edenred to resolve the deficiencies in the current system or urgently implementing a suitable alternative.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the work of Burntisland Heritage Trust to have Andrew Young&#8217;s 1923 work entitled, Bridge of Life restored; notes the remarkable local importance of the work, which has hung in the Burgh Chambers since the artist&#8217;s death in 1925, with each character shown in the painting being a local person from Burntisland at that time; welcomes future plans to hold an open event to celebrate the restoration of this profound local masterpiece; and pays gratitude to Burntisland Heritage Trust, Burntisland Common Good Fund, and Co-op Local Community Fund for raising the funds necessary to carry out the conservation project.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the news that Inverness Science Festival will now be hosted virtually; commends the organisers for their decision to move the Festival online in the current circumstances; notes that there will be events such as video lectures, children&#8217;s activities, competitions, and a pub quiz running from the 1st to 16th May; and thanks all those who&#8217;s hard work and effort allowed for this event to go ahead.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Claudia Webbe</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Byrne</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ms Diane Abbott</p>
			<p>That this House is alarmed at the growing evidence that black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) people are over-represented in hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19  and that there are clear systemic economic inequalities that are meaning that ethnic minority communities are being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus crisis; is concerned at reports that almost three quarters of NHS and social care staff who have died of covid-19 have a BAME background; laments that years of austerity has had an utterly devastating impact on ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately disadvantaged by public sector cuts; and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety of BAME workers, particularly NHS and care staff, on the frontline and to take immediate action to address the unequal health and economic effects of covid-19 on the UK&#8217;s black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) groups.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	4/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the Government&#8217;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled it to work with businesses and trade unions to protect the economy and avoid mass redundancies; appreciates the role aviation workers have played in operating flights, repatriating citizens and delivering essential medical and personal protective equipment supplies; considers it deplorable that whilst IAG is taking UK tax payers&#8217; money, as well as using Spanish government guaranteed loans to purchase an additional airline for the group at a cost of &#8364;1.2 Billion, it is serving notice of redundancies to UK employees with</p>
			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the vital role that the road freight and logistics sector has played during the COVID-19 pandemic ensuring that food and vital medical supplies have kept moving; further notes that many within the sector continue to face significant financial challenges due to the lockdown of other industries such as retail and construction; calls on the Government to ensure that all parts of the industry are protected through the crisis such that they ensure the economy can bounce back as the Prime Minister has suggested; and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that further measures are introduced to support the sector now and during the UK&#8217;s recovery including a 100 per cent Government backed invoice financing scheme, suspension of fuel duty for the sector, greater flexibility in the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the expansion of the business rates holiday to include all haulage sites and a new lorry retention scheme to ensure those hauliers whose trucks are currently not in use can survive.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes news that a new reportedly fast and accurate coronavirus antibody test has been developed by blood-screening firm Quotien, based in Scotland and Switzerland; understands that each serological screening machine has capacity for up to 3,000 tests a day and produces results in 35 minutes with 99.8 per cent accuracy; notes that Quotien&#8217;s Scottish research division is based in Penicuik, Midlothian; applauds the cooperative global efforts of the scientific community to find innovative means of tackling the pandemic; and recognises that Midlothian continues to punch above its weight in research and science.</p>

			<p>That this House applauds the community response to social isolation in Highbank Care Home; welcomes efforts by the Rotary Club of Esk Valley and Eskbank and Newbattle Community Council to gather and donate TVs to care home residents feeling isolated; understands that the 40 residents, all aged over 60, are having to remain in their rooms for up to 24hrs a day, with none of their usual communal activities currently available and a number of residents previously having no access to television in their rooms; applauds the Rotary Club of Esk Valley and Eskbank and Newbattle Community Council for their organising efforts; and further applauds the collections of toiletries handed in from Newbattle Abbey Crescent, and W H Smith and Tesco in Dalkeith donating arts and crafts activities and books.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Barry Sheerman</p>
			<p>That this House notes that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is currently advising British nationals against all but essential travel indefinitely; further notes that the indefinite nature of the advice means that insurance companies do not have to refund schools for school trips that cannot go ahead until a couple of days before the planned departure; recognises schools choosing to cancel trips are unable to claim from their insurer; further recognises that requiring parents to continue paying instalments for trips that will most likely not go ahead is putting a number of families, who are already hard hit by Coronavirus measures, under financial strain; and calls on the Government to issue a ban on school trips for the rest of this academic year to enable schools to claim back the costs of their planned trips from their insurers without delay.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Liz Saville Roberts</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mr Barry Sheerman</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the warnings of increased risk of pandemics from the destruction of nature, in particularly by four world-leading scientists from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) as published on 27 April 2020; further notes their diagnosis that rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of intensive farming, mining, infrastructure and global air travel, and exploitation of wild species have created a perfect storm for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people; accepts the conclusion that recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity &#8211; particularly global financial and economic systems based on a limited paradigm of economic growth; supports the scientists&#8217; proposals for government action to reduce the risks of future outbreaks and pandemics; therefore urges Ministers to follow the science by adopting the recommendations to strengthen environmental regulations, urgently and fundamentally transform industries including aviation and intensive agriculture, and properly fund health systems on the frontlines of pandemic risk; and calls on the Government adopt a One Health approach at all levels of decision-making, recognising the complex interconnections between the health of people, animals, plants and our shared environment; and further calls on the Government to embark on a fundamental system-wide reorganisation to end business as usual and emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient by protecting the natural world of which humans are a part.</p>

			<p>That this House applauds the excellent work of consumer organisation Which? in its investigations into price-gouging during the Covid19 crisis; is deeply concerned with the recent trend of unreasonable hikes in the prices of essential items by online retailers due to the covid-19 pandemic, a practice known as price gouging; understands that there have been reports of excessive price rises for essential items such as cleaning products and baby formula, due to the coronavirus crisis, particularly through online retailers such as eBay and Amazon; is shocked by the findings of Which? that there has been a 1000 per cent increase in the prices of products like Dettol cleaning spray by some third party sellers online and in response has launched an app to help people more easily report coronavirus profiteering; urges people to report any instances of price gouging of which they become aware; condemns those seeking to make excessive profits at the time of a global health crisis, which will cause huge difficulties for those in need of some basic essential items; understands that large online retailers like eBay and Amazon are now working to address price gouging and urges them to do more to do more to monitor and regulate what their sellers are charging; and calls on the Government to introduce stronger regulations to prevent this price gouging and give the Competition and Markets Authority greater powers to investigate and tackle this important issue.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that migrant communities, who are disproportionately at risk of exclusion, stigma and discrimination, are not currently receiving the necessary safeguards; further notes that the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians, and Doctors of the World have called on the Government to suspend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 and 2017 and all associated immigration checks and data sharing; believes that it is vital that a clear message is sent to migrant communities that they can seek care when they need it, that they are included in society and have a part to play in response to this crisis; and therefore calls on the Government to suspend all NHS charging for migrants, suspend all data sharing between health services and the Home Office, implement a firewall to ensure that patient data will not be shared with the Home Office or other bodies for the purposes of immigration enforcement, and launch an information campaign to ensure both NHS staff and the public are aware of these changes and that it is safe for people to seek care, particularly aimed at migrant communities across the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that one of the World Health Organisation's six preconditions for lifting lockdowns includes the capacity to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact; is deeply concerned that this precondition is not reflected in the Government&#8217;s five tests for exiting lockdown and believes that this omission risks putting more lives in jeopardy; believes that while appropriately protected phone apps will have an important role to play, their use will need to be coupled with human-led contact tracing to be effective; further believes that the best way to prevent further covid-19 outbreaks and new lockdowns is to put in place a nationwide system of testing, identifying infected individuals, tracing their contacts, and imposing supported quarantine requirements; therefore urges the Government to widen its criteria for exiting lockdown to include the WHO recommendations on testing, tracing and isolating contacts; calls on the Government to urgently put in place the infrastructure for these community shields via a comprehensive, targeted system to report, isolate, test, monitor and contract trace, thereby creating a network of community-based protection schemes to respond quickly to any re-emergence of covid-19 once the current lockdown is lifted; and recommends that this action should be coordinated by Public Health England&#8217;s regional Outbreak Management Teams and the appropriate devolved Public Health bodies, working in coordination with GPs, local authority public health teams, and suitably experienced and trained volunteers.</p>

			<p>That this House is gravely concerned by serious human rights violations occurring across the world as a result of the coronavirus pandemic; notes that restrictions on human rights in response to a national public health emergency must be lawful, proportionate, necessary, subject to review, and limited in duration, and that prohibitions against arbitrary deprivation of life, torture and other ill-treatment are absolute; is alarmed at reports of the well-being of vulnerable populations in many countries, such as prisoners, slum-dwellers, the homeless, refugees and migrants, not being properly protected; is also alarmed at reports of governments adopting disproportionate measures which could be used inter alia to suppress freedom of expression and media freedom, such as in Hungary, Cambodia and Thailand, as well as of police using excessive force to enforce restrictions, such as in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa; urges all governments to ensure any curtailment of fundamental freedoms during this emergency are entirely legitimate; and calls on the Government to use its global influence to help curb unlawful human rights infringements during the pandemic and to assist less developed countries in better protecting vulnerable communities and channelling further resources into their healthcare and welfare systems.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises there are loopholes in the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme for new starters; acknowledges that the support offered of 80 per cent of wages up to &#163;2,500 a month is vital for workers during the coronavirus outbreak; recognises that the cut-off date of 19 March 2020 for an employer to submit an RTI notification to HMRC means in practice that people who started jobs in March are exempt from the furlough scheme; believes the Government&#8217;s proposed solution for those missed by the scheme to be re-hired by previous employers is inadequate because tight guidelines for furloughing former staff do not fit all circumstances and past employers have no legal requirement to re-hire staff; understands the lack of support offered to new starters means many households are being pushed into debt and destitution; recognises the Government&#8217;s aim to combat fraudulent claims through use of a cut-off date, but suggests other methods of doing so, such as submission of employment contracts; notes the strength of feeling among those missed by the scheme who are taking part in the #newstarterfurlough campaigns on social media; and urges the Chancellor to close the loopholes and extend the furlough scheme to new starters.</p>

			<p>That this House warmly congratulates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq, as it lifts the lockdown, for its concerted measures that have so far contained the spread of coronavirus in a population of about 6 million people to 347 cases and four deaths; notes that the KRG carries 70 per cent of the burden of the nearly $1 billion annual cost for providing basic services to over a million internally displaced people and refugees from Syria, many in camps, and who account for one fifth of the population; further recognises that sharp decreases in oil prices present grave difficulties given that Kurdistan and Iraq rely so heavily on oil revenues; hopes that the Iraqi government and the KRG can soon reach a long-term agreement on oil and revenue-sharing; and urges the caretaker government in Baghdad not to proceed with plans to cut federal subventions to the Kurdistan Region.</p>
