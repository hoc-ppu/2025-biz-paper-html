			<p>That this House congratulates the Reverend Aftab Gohar, minister of Abbotsgrange Parish Kirk in Grangemouth, upon his election as the new Moderator of the Church of Scotland Presbytery of Falkirk; recognises that his recent installation as such made history by his becoming the first South Asian-born cleric to be elected a Presbytery Moderator of any Presbyterian denomination in Scotland, as well as that of the national Church of Scotland; acknowledges the commendable outreach work that Rev&#8217;d Gohar has conducted to engage with and spiritually support the local community in Grangemouth since his moving to the congregation from Pakistan in 2008; further notes that this year also marks a quarter of a century since his ordination as a church minister at St. John's Cathedral in the Pakistani city of Peshawar where he had a fruitful and much-appreciated ministry among the Pashtun and Afghani communities of the North West Frontier; and wishes Rev&#8217;d Gohar continued success and fulfilment in his future pastoral endeavours within the Falkirk area and beyond.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House notes that the acute hospital in Watford was the first hospital to be built under the reign of Queen Victoria; further notes that the hospital has since been developed in an ad hoc manner and that the deterioration of its facilities has made it harder for the excellent doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff to carry out their work; notes that there is a lack of affordable parking facilities for staff, patients and visitors as a result of its location next to a Premier League football club; recognises the further pressure put on the hospital's facilities following the closure of acute services at St Albans and Hemel Hempstead which were opposed by the majority of local residents; and calls on the Government to halt the taxpayer-funded redevelopment of the Watford site and welcome the news that &#163;590m is available for a new acute hospital on a greenfield site that can serve all of the growing population of West Hertfordshire.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that experts widely predict the UK could be set to lose tens of thousands of lives unnecessarily to cancer as a result of the cancer backlog induced as a consequence of the NHS&#8217;s response to the covid-19 pandemic, and notes the crisis in cancer services highlighted in BBC&#8217;s Panorama investigation; welcomes the calls of the Catch Up With Cancer campaign for an emergency response and national effort to get all cancer services, from diagnostic through to cancer treatments and trials, back up and running with immediate effect; recognises smart and immediate solutions that will raise cancer services to world class levels are needed, including the implementation of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Radiotherapy&#8217;s 6 point plan to transform radiotherapy, and bring in a full cancer recover plan with the same level of urgency, energy and as was deployed against the virus itself; and notes that NHS England&#8217;s reported ambition of bringing services back to normal levels by the end of the year is not sufficient in ambition or urgency.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	13/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bob Blackman [R] </p>
			<p>That this House notes the acts of aggression by Armenia overnight on 12 July 2020 which further escalates the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan which is rooted in Armenia's military control over Azerbaijan's Nagorno Karabakh region and adjacent seven districts that in the early 1990s led to the death of 30,000 people and the fleeing of more than 1 million internally displaced persons from their homes; calls on the UK Government to condemn the recent actions of Armenia which represent a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process and which have violated international law as well as the ceasefire agreement signed in 1994; further notes that the military flare up along the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the involvement of heavy artillery is a flagrant violation of international law as well as the ceasefire agreed in 1994 and represents a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process; urges the UK Government to support the call for the OSCE Minsk Group to investigate thoroughly to prevent the current military action escalating into an all-out war; and further calls on the UK Government to urge for the withdrawal of Armenian military forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan as stated in UN Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Daisy Cooper</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir George Howarth</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the World Intellectual Property Organisation&#8217;s Beijing Treaty on Audio-Visual Performances which came into force on 28 April 2020; notes that the aim of that Treaty is to extend the economic and moral rights of actors and performers in audio-visual performances including films, videos and television programs; is concerned that not all signatories who have ratified that Treaty have done so in ways that are consistent with that aim; recognises the importance of the audio-visual industry to the UK economy and the integral role played by audio-visual performers who enrich our daily lives with their craft; considers that ratifying the Treaty in such a way as to allow for the economic and moral rights of actors and performers to be immediately transferred to the producer undermines a performer&#8217;s remuneration right; understands the importance of the concept of national treatment to secure revenues from usage of work in other countries; calls on the Government to enable an early ratification of the Beijing Treaty in line with that Treaty&#8217;s clearly stated aims; and further calls on the Government to undertake early talks with secondary users to ensure a fair and affordable system for upholding performers&#8217; rights.</p>
