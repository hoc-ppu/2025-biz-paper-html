			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ronnie Cowan</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neil Gray</p>
			<p>That this House notes the recent publication of the report entitled Assessing the Feasibility of Citizens&#8217; Basic Income Pilots in Scotland which presents comprehensive and detailed research into the feasibility of a citizens&#8217; basic income pilot in Scotland; further notes that it has been developed by a successful collaboration of local government and public health bodies supported by the Scottish Government; and calls on the UK Government to work with the Scottish Government on developing a basic income pilot and to instruct HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions to co-operate with the Scottish Government as they seek to establish such a pilot scheme.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	2/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Claudia Webbe</p>
			<p>That this house welcomes the lockdown extension in Leicester and parts of the county of Leicestershire to protect lives from coronavirus; stands in solidarity with the people of Leicester whose lives face further disruption while lockdown is relaxed in the rest of the country; understands the additional effect that that lockdown will have on businesses; recognises that Leicester is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse areas of the country; rejects any attempt to blame Leicester residents for the increase in the rate of infection; and calls for unity within Leicester, across the county and throughout the country to defeat covid-19.</p>
			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Stewart Malcolm McDonald</span><span class="signatory">Anne McLaughlin</span><span class="signatory">Tony Lloyd</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that currently in the UK there are an unknown number of persons who are not UK citizens, who do not have leave to remain in this country, who lack any entitlement to support from the state, who are therefore entirely without funds to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families and who are unable to comply with Government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing; and considers it essential that the Government takes immediate action to ensure that leave to remain in the UK is granted to all such persons who are within the UK but are not citizens, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status, so that they can access healthcare, food and housing to enable them to adhere to Government advice on social distancing, ensure the health of themselves and their families and help protect the health of all people in the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Edward Davey</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern that as a result of measures taken to halt the spread of covid-19, live performances have been unable to take place; further notes that live music events have all but ceased to exist and as a consequence, many performers and those providing light and sound services have had no income during the covid-19 lockdown; expresses great concern that, without urgent additional Government support, many performers and the companies that support them face imminent financial ruin; and calls on Government to put together an urgent package of support to enable live performances to survive.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Gavin Newlands</span><span class="signatory">Anne McLaughlin</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the &#163;354 million of arrears owed to families under the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) with just &#163;31 million having been collected through enforcement action in the latest quarter; futher notes that 43 per cent of cases under Collect and Pay arrangements are not receiving any maintenance; recognises that according to a 2019 study by Hakovirta et al, the full and timely payment of maintenance could lift 60 per cent of families living in poverty out of poverty; further recognises the increased hardship families are facing as a result of covied-19; supports those single-parents seeking a judicial review of the Department for Work and Pensions for their persistent failure to collect maintenance; calls on the Government to take action to secure the maintenance to which families have a legal right, including a root and branch review of the CMS to ensure it works effectively for the children it is supposed to serve, to increase enforcement action against non-compliant, non-resident parents, to improve enforcement powers for the CMS, and to introduce a Minimum Maintenance Payment to provide parents-with-care and their children a guaranteed income to prevent hardship and ensure a dignified standard of living.</p>

			<p>That this House commemorates the 25th anniversary of the passing of Gordon Wilson who was a tremendous advocate for peace during the Troubles; notes that he won the BBC Today programme's man of the year due to his determination to see good brought out of evil and to forgive those who had murdered his daughter; and encourages those who are remembering and celebrating men of war at present to remember that blessed are the peacemakers.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir Edward Davey</span></p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the publication of a report into the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers by Philip Taylor, Professor of Work and Employment Studies, at the University of Strathclyde; recognises that the report raises concerns about unsafe working environments at many call centres including poor social distancing measures, hot-desking, poor cleansing and a lack of remote or home-working options; notes that the report records concerning levels of anxiety and fear among call-centre staff regarding their risk of catching or transferring covid-19 in their workplace; further notes that the report considers the matter to be as much a public health concern as an occupational health issue due to the risk of call centre workers spreading infection; appreciates that, while the document is focused on Scotland, the content and recommendations are equally applicable to the rest of the UK; further recognises that the report makes a number of recommendations including evacuating problematic workplaces, facilitating greater homeworking, auditing call centres and the implementation of appropriate health and safety and testing measures; and calls on the Government to reflect on the evidence and recommendations in that report and consider what actions it can take to help protect call centre workers throughout the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to urgently reinstate the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it can publish the delayed report on alleged Russian Interference in UK democracy; notes that this is the longest period following an election that the Intelligence and Security Committee has gone without being reinstated; and calls on the Government to be fully transparent and open with the public about any activity which may compromise the integrity of our democracy.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jonathan Edwards</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mhairi Black</span></p>
			<p>That this House believes that the decision to reinstate benefit sanctions in the middle of a health and economic crisis is a profoundly callous step; further believes that this is an ideologically driven, punitive measure which simply adds to the stress and anxiety for people who are already facing hard times; notes that removing benefits and forcing people to use food banks to feed their families does nothing to help anyone back to work; and urgently calls on the Government to extend the suspension of sanctions as the covid-19 crisis continues and the numbers claiming universal credit soar, with a view to scrapping benefit sanctions altogether.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Dr Julian Lewis</span><span class="signatory">Jim Shannon</span><span class="signatory">Jonathan Edwards</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the important role played by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC since it opened its doors to the public on 24 September 2016, documenting and enabling the study of the life, history and culture of African Americans; notes that it serves as a place of collaboration to work with many other museums and educational institutions that have explored and preserved this important history; asserts the national importance of the life, history and culture of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities in the UK and their global influences; believes that there should be a DCMS-sponsored national UK museum for the study of Black, Asian and minority ethnic history and culture on a similar scale and model to the Washington Museum; and calls on the Government, whilst reviewing inequalities&#8217; issues generally, to make an assessment of the potential merits of such a national museum.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that it has been one year since the all-party Parliamentary group on Terminal Illness published its report on the legal definition of terminal illness; condemns the rules of the Department for Work and Pensions which mean that benefits are only fast-tracked if a terminally ill person has a diagnosis of six months or less to live; recognises that the Scottish Government has committed to ruling out the six month rule when it takes over the personal independence payment; and urges the Government to do the same.</p>
