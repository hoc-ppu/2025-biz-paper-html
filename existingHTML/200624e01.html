			<p>That this House notes the significant investment made in the National Cyber Security Centre to protect the UK from cyber-attacks; recognises the Government&#8217;s attempts to help small and medium-sized enterprises across the UK improve their digital security through the National Cyber Security Strategy; and calls for increased promotion of the Cyber Essentials scheme and exposition of the Cyber Aware campaign, as a matter of urgency, to encourage the public and businesses to take up secure online behaviours that help to protect against the most common cyber-attacks that have increased during the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Martyn Day</p>
			<p>That this House recognises prison officers carry out some of the hardest public service work in dangerous and often violent conditions; notes that prison officers are expected to continue to carry out this work until they are 68 years old; acknowledges that people living longer does not always equate to their physical and mental abilities being able to withstand the daily demands faced by prison officers; declares that prison officers&#8217; retirement age should be aligned with that of police officers who can retire at 60 years old; urges the Government to accept that 68 is too old to cope with the physical and mental challenges of being a prison officer; and further urges the Government to give prison officers the same consideration as police officers, who deal with the same type of offenders on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>This this House is concerned to learn the important BBC regional programme Inside Out North West  is under threat as the corporation seeks to make cuts to programming; understands that regional segments of the Politics North West are similarly threatened; regrets that all filming of these award-winning BBC regional current affairs programmes have been postponed and the programmes look likely to be cancelled following an internal review expected by the end of the month; notes that Inside Out is a unique programme, rooted in the heart of local communities, investigating and holding those in power to account and telling remarkable stories of life across the region; further notes that the programme has helped to bring issues of public concern to national attention, serving a valuable function in the democratic life at local authority and constituency-wide level; and supports the call of the National Union of Journalists for the BBC to rethink the proposals to cut these vital, local current affairs programmes.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the hospitality industry to the wider economy; notes that pubs, bars and restaurants lie at the heart of many communities; notes that the sector has been severely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, with around 80 per cent of the UK&#8217;s 3.2 million hospitality workers being furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; is concerned that many establishments will be unable to reopen when the scheme comes to an end; highlights that the Licensing Act 2003 prohibits the sale of alcohol from a vehicle or movable structure unless there is a premises licenses at each location at which a sale of alcohol is made; further highlight that this rule prohibits many establishments from reorienting their business models to take covid-19 restrictions into account; calls on the Government to amend Sections 189 and Sections 190 of the Licensing Act 2003 to allow all licensed premises to be able to operate delivery services without having to seek changes to their premises license; further calls on the Government to allow all registered breweries to sell alcohol directly to customers.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes International Women Day in Engineering, which fell on 23 June 2020 to raise the profile of women engineers and encourage more people to consider engineering as a profession for all; recognises the work of Syeda Ghufran, the first female Engineering Director at ScotRail, out of nearly 200 colleagues at Haymarket depot in 2010; appreciates that Syeda Ghufran is committed to promoting gender diversity and equality through her role; notes that she has worked with local schools to promote engineering as a career choice for young people; further notes that ScotRail's recent intake of Engineering Apprentices are 50 per cent female; understands that women remain vastly underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) sectors, with only 12 per cent of engineering professionals in the UK being female; believes that there are many positive actions that can be taken, including outreach, placements and training to target women and girls; and calls for greater promotion of women and girls to join STEM industries.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that currently in the UK there are an unknown number of persons who are not UK citizens, who do not have leave to remain in this country, who lack any entitlement to support from the state, who are therefore entirely without funds to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families and who are unable to comply with Government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing; and considers it essential that the Government takes immediate action to ensure that leave to remain in the UK is granted to all such persons who are within the UK but are not citizens, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status, so that they can access healthcare, food and housing to enable them to adhere to Government advice on social distancing, ensure the health of themselves and their families and help protect the health of all people in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the opportunity for exploring shorter working time for the UK, including a four-day week, as one route out of the covid-19 pandemic; further recognises that work patterns have been dramatically altered as a result of the pandemic, notes that shorter working time has been used throughout history as a way of responding to economic crises; believes that a four-day week could bring multiple benefits to society, the environment, democracy, and the economy through increased productivity; congratulates Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand for speaking about the four-day week as a key way in which New Zealand&#8217;s economy can recover from the crisis; highlights the Scottish Government&#8217;s announcement in May that its Post-Covid-19 Futures Commission plans to explore the potential for a four-day working week for Scotland; and calls on the Government to make the same commitment towards a better future for the UK by setting up a comparable commission to consider a range of options and models in relation to shorter working times.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to introduce fair tax conditions on companies benefiting from Treasury-funded support schemes introduced due to the covid-19 crisis and that companies registered in tax havens should be excluded; further calls on the Government to instruct any benefiting business to publish a binding tax policy that explicitly opposes tax avoidance and the artificial use of tax havens, ensure that the consolidated annual profit and loss of the parent company is publicly available, with details of the associated corporation tax payments on a country-by country basis for multinational enterprise, and make clear who the ultimate beneficial owners of the business are and those with significant control; applauds organisations such as Fair Tax Mark, Tax Justice UK, The Co-Operative Party and Church Action for Tax Justice for campaigning on this issue of tax fairness; believes that it is wholly wrong for public funds to be bailing out offshore billionaires and companies that dodge paying tax into the public purse; notes that over 80 per cent of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong; and believes that both businesses and Government have a responsibility to do all possible to support and protect workers and services, but that this should be accompanied with fair tax conditions.</p>
