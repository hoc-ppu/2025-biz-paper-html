			<p>That this House notes that 17 May is the annual International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Transphobia and Interphobia to highlight the violence and discrimination that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex communities and other people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities or expressions, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) continue to face; further notes with concern that the covid-19 pandemic is increasing inequalities for many marginalised groups globally, including LGBT+ people particularly in the areas of access to healthcare, housing, employment as well as misuse of emergency powers and increase in hate crime and domestic abuse for those in lockdown; celebrates civil society defending LGBT+ rights around the world, including in the jurisdictions where LGBT+ identities remain criminalised; commends the UK&#8217;s role as co-chair of the intergovernmental Equal Rights Coalition which advocates for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people; maintains the importance of the UK&#8217;s role in promoting and protecting LGBT+ rights globally; and calls on the Government to continue to advance and uphold the rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sammy Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain&#8217;s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as &#163;40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Drew Hendry</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the unprecedented impact of covid-19 on the maritime economy; supports the RMT trade union&#8217;s proposals for protecting UK maritime workers from the long-term economic effects of the coronavirus crisis; calls for no compulsory redundancies of UK seafarers, dock or port workers during or after the covid-19 crisis; urges the Government to ensure that furlough and cash flow support payments only go to shipping companies that state their commitment to long term investment in employment and training for UK seafarers; demands reform of the UK Ship Register and the end Red Ensign Group to restore the link with employment for domestic Ratings and Officers in order to limit the possibility of companies and individuals to avoid tax liabilities and use low-cost labour; requests increased public funding for training and developing UK Ratings; and urges the Government to implement these necessary measures to build a resilient and stable maritime future.</p>

			<p>That this house notes that hospitality and the UK tourism industry are among the hardest hit by the necessary social distancing policies in place during the covid-19 outbreak; further notes that 80 per cent of workers in the hotel and food industries are furloughed and up to a third may be at risk in the longer term of losing their jobs; recognises that in the Lake District 80 per cent of the working population are employed in tourism or hospitality; further recognises research from Cumbria Tourism indicating that the cost of coronavirus in Cumbria may reach &#163;1.45 billion by May 2020, translating into 18,459 job losses; further notes that the seasonal nature of the tourism industry means that many businesses will not be able to generate the necessary level of income to avoid closing down after the support packages end; and calls on the Government to introduce a 12 month financial support package to secure the survival of the UK tourism and hospitality industry until the summer of 2021.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that Scotland&#8217;s public commemorations of the 75th anniversary of VE Day will be held online on 8 May; understands that due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, plans for the landmark anniversary &#8211; which were to include a parade, public concert and reception &#8211; will now take place online, with a video message of thanks from the First Minister of Scotland and a concert, in addition to the service and silence; acknowledges Legion Scotland and Poppy Scotland, in partnership with the Scottish Government, for their outstanding work in helping people across Scotland come together virtually to give thanks to our World War Two generation; and honours the service and dedication of all those who helped secure peace 75 years ago, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mike Hill</span><span class="signatory">Richard Burgon</span><span class="signatory">Ms Diane Abbott</span></p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>That this House is alarmed at the growing evidence that black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) people are over-represented in hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19  and that there are clear systemic economic inequalities that are meaning that ethnic minority communities are being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus crisis; is concerned at reports that almost three quarters of NHS and social care staff who have died of covid-19 have a BAME background; laments that years of austerity has had an utterly devastating impact on ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately disadvantaged by public sector cuts; and calls on the Government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety of BAME workers, particularly NHS and care staff, on the frontline and to take immediate action to address the unequal health and economic effects of covid-19 on the UK&#8217;s black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) groups.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that the Government&#8217;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled it to work with businesses and trade unions to protect the economy and avoid mass redundancies; appreciates the role aviation workers have played in operating flights, repatriating citizens and delivering essential medical and personal protective equipment supplies; considers it deplorable that whilst IAG is taking UK tax payers&#8217; money, as well as using Spanish government guaranteed loans to purchase an additional airline for the group at a cost of &#8364;1.2 Billion, it is serving notice of redundancies to UK employees with</p>
			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the awarding of the contract for the clean-up of radioactive material at Dalgety Bay beach by the Ministry of Defence earlier this year; notes that the beach became contaminated with radioactive particles originating from the instrument panels of military aircraft dumped at the site after WWII; observes that the contamination was first discovered in 1990 during a SEPA survey and that the clean-up operation has experienced repeated delays since the MoD was appointed the Appropriate Person responsible for remediation in 2013; understands that the work is set to include clearing the beach of contaminated material and installing a barrier to prevent other material rising to the surface from the sea bed; believes that the first phase of remediation works is due to commence imminently; pays tribute to numerous local community representatives who have pursued this matter doggedly, including Councillors David Barratt and Alice McGarry, and former hon. Member Roger Mullin, all of whom have worked tirelessly to push the MoD to progress this longstanding project; and urges the UK Government to take every possible step to reduce the risk of any potential delay to the commencement of those works as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House, fully supporting the sport of shooting and the private ownership of firearms within the law, notes the importance to public safety of monitoring the medical health of firearms certificate holders during the lifetime of their certificates; further notes that Government policy, as expressed in Home Office guidance on firearms licensing, asks general practitioners to place a marker on the medical notes of certificate holders so that a doctor treating the certificate holder will know that they own firearms and can make police aware if concerns arise; is therefore most concerned at the number of police constabularies which have instituted practices in breach of Home Office guidance by adopting medical verification of certificate applications without providing for markers to be placed on medical notes; considers this a failure to implement Government policy which falls short in protecting public safety; and calls on the Government to ensure that an effective and efficient system of medical involvement in firearms licensing through the placing of markers on certificate holders medical notes is implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>
