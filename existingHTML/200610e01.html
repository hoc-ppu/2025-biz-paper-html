			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p>That this House expresses regret at the decision by the EFL to abruptly end the season for Football League One and League Two; believes that this action undermines the public&#8217;s confidence in sporting integrity and reduces the status of these league competitions; calls on the EFL to financially compensate season ticket holders who had a reasonable expectation for the season to be completed and determined by sporting achievement and not through back-room deals; further believes that the failure to complete a professional football league competition highlights the failings of those leagues; notes that the Premier League and Championship will resume and meet their obligations to fans and maintain the integrity of their leagues; further notes the precarious financial position of many clubs outside of the Premier League; notes that the lion&#8217;s share of TV revenue and commercial sponsorship is directed towards a few elite clubs in the Premier League at the expense of the wider football pyramid; and calls on the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport to urgently investigate the financial sustainability of English Football and consider proposals such as team salary caps to replace the current dysfunctional and unfair Financial Fair Play Rules which are widening the gap between the richest and poorest clubs; further calls on the Government to carry out a root and branch review of football governance due to the increasingly precarious finances of the majority of football clubs; and asserts that Bury Football Club should be reinstated to Football League provided that they can prove financial viability for the start of the 2020-21 season.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Kevan Jones</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the life-changing injustices experienced by subpostmasters throughout the Horizon scandal; notes with the deepest sadness that subpostmasters have served custodial sentences and suffered bankruptcy for offences they did not commit; recognises the role of the Government in prolonging this crisis through not fulfilling their role of shareholder representation on the board of Post Office Limited; expresses concern at the scope and formation of the inquiry currently outlined by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; and strongly urges the Government to institute a judge-led public inquiry into this matter at the earliest opportunity.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Douglas Chapman</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the effort made by volunteers at the Vine Church in Dunfermline to provide hot meals to residents in the area through its Free Meals Dunfermline initiative; further recognises how volunteers have handed out 100 meals a day, seven days a week, which has meant 2,500 hot meals have been delivered to households across Dunfermline and West Fife, helping those who are shielding or have found themselves in extreme financial hardship during the pandemic; and further recognises the contribution made by the catering team at Better Buffets who have cooked the fresh meals that have been distributed to thousands.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Ms Diane Abbott</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that many workers earning the minimum wage are currently only receiving 80 per cent of their minimum wage salary under the Government&#8217;s furlough scheme; is concerned that workers are being expected to live on less than the state-declared minimum wage especially given that rents, bills and food prices have not fallen; is concerned that in the House on 12 May 2020, following a question calling for the introduction of a minimum wage floor to the furlough scheme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer responding by suggesting that workers could seek additional employment which for many is not possible during the covid-19 crisis; notes that women and Black, Asian and minority ethnic workers are more likely to be in lower-paid work; calls on the Government to put in place guarantees to ensure that no furloughed worker is forced to live on less than 100 per cent of the national minimum wage.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Owen Thompson</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the support provided through the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that that scheme will not cover claimants beyond the end of May 2020; regrets that many self-employed people have not been eligible for that scheme due to anomalies in that scheme's criteria; notes that the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) has been extended by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in full until the end of July 2020 and partially until October 2020; calls on the Government to commit to introducing a second phase of the SEISS providing a taxable grant of 80 per cent of claimants&#8217; average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering June 2020 and July 2020; further calls on the Government to introduce a third phase of that scheme covering August 2020 to October 2020, providing partial support along similar lines to the CJRS' partial extension; and urges the Government to correct the anomalies that occurred in the first phase of the SEISS to ensure that help is provided to all self-employed people who require it.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Tim Farron</span><span class="signatory">John Nicolson</span><span class="signatory">Marion Fellows</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that over two months have passed since the President of the Houthi Supreme Political Council in Yemen ordered the release of six Baha&#8217;is, who have been in long term detention in Sana&#8217;a; further notes that this includes Mr Hamed bin Haydara who was under sentence of death and that President al-Mashat ordered his pardon on 25 March; observes that all six Baha&#8217;is are still imprisoned, and that reports confirm that other detainees in their prison facility have contracted covid-19; and urges the Government to make fresh and urgent appeals to the Houthi authorities to expedite the President&#8217;s orders for release of these six prisoners of conscience.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Layla Moran</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the need for Government action to support economic renewal as covid-19 restrictions are lifted; believes that this recovery must be a green recovery, designed to deliver the urgent objectives of restoring wildlife and the natural environment on land and at sea, averting dangerous climate change, minimising the UK&#8217;s global environmental footprint, and reversing inequality; considers that strong environmental laws are necessary for public health and a resilient economy, and to ensure more people benefit from the joys of nature that many have experienced or longed for in lockdown; further notes that green projects create more jobs, deliver higher short-term returns, and lead to increased long-term cost savings according to a recent Oxford study among others; believes that restoring the environment requires close collaboration with civil society organisations; calls on the Government to pursue an green economic recovery strategy that gives top priority to the health and wellbeing of people and nature; and further calls on the Government to avoid all measures that contribute to environmental harm and instead to invest in nature-friendly farming, large-scale green infrastructure projects including habitat restoration and creation, improved and equitable access to high-quality greenspace, a regenerative circular zero-waste economy that reduces resource use and addresses over-consumption, and a decisive shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy alongside nature-based solutions to climate change.</p>
