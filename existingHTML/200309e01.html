			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rachel Hopkins</p>
			<p>That this House commemorates for International Women&#8217;s Day the Matchgirls who went on strike in 1888 at the Bryant and May factory in Bow in response to poor working conditions; notes that factory workers were expected to work 14 hour days for poor pay in an unsafe working environment due to the exposure of phosphorus which was used to make matches; commends their achievements of scrapping the factory&#8217;s fine system, setting up a grievance system, abolishing the deductions for working materials and the improvement of health and safety standards; further notes the continued need to advocate for high labour standards; and recognises the Matchgirls as pioneers of gender equality and fairness at work who through their strike action and formation of the Union of Women Match Makers left a lasting legacy on the trade union movement.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patrick Grady</p>
			<p>That this House notes that 8 March 2020 marked 42 years since the first broadcast of the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy radio series on BBC Radio 4; further notes that the series by the late Douglas Adams went on to appear in various and contradictory manifestations including novels, video games, stage and film adaptations; notes that the works have sold more than 14 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of different languages; believes that the appeal of the works lies in a gentle and wide-ranging humour which contrasts mundane aspects of daily life with the fantastical opportunities of science and exploration, including the famous proposition that the number 42 represents the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, and that the best response in any given situation is don't panic; and expresses its thanks and best wishes to the family and estate of Douglas Adams and all those who have been associated with the production, publication and performance of the works over the last 42 years.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	9/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">John Nicolson</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the decision of the Clydesdale Bank to close the Crieff High Street branch; further notes that Crieff has already lost a number of bank branches in recent years; notes that surrounding towns and villages in rural Perthshire depend upon this branch in Crieff for business and personal banking services; acknowledges that not everyone has access to online banking and can&#8217;t always travel the extra distance to alternative branches due to transport and mobility issues; and urges the Government to work with Clydesdale Bank to ensure that nobody in Crieff is left to suffer from financial exclusion as a result of the decision, and that cashpoint access is maintained in the absence of a branch.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	9/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Peter Bottomley</p>
			<p>That this House celebrates Commonwealth Day and the shared goals and bonds between Commonwealth nations, but regrets that half a million UK pensioners living overseas in so-called frozen countries, of which over 90 per cent are Commonwealth nations, are suffering unfairly because the value of their pension is frozen and not up-rated annually in line with inflation, plunging thousands of UK pensioners including veterans and former public servants into poverty; and calls on the Government to uprate the pensions of all UK pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">267</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Real fur imports</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Maria Eagle</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alex Norris</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sammy Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House urges the Government to introduce legislation to ban the imports and sales of real fur products; notes that the UK has long banned the main methods of fur so-called production, namely leg-hold trapping and fur factory farming, due to their inherent cruelty; believes that, in view of these bans, it is hypocritical to continue to allow the import of real fur; further notes that the fur industry in the UK has significantly declined over the last 40 years, is now rejected by the majority of global fashion houses and UK high street retailers, and that fur sales are soon to be banned in California; acknowledges that there is a political and legal opportunity for a fur ban with the UK leaving the European Union; further acknowledges that there is widespread public support for a fur ban; and further believes that a fur ban is a natural extension of the existing import bans on cat and dog fur and commercial seal products, and that a comprehensive fur ban will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the promotion of animal welfare.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">268</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Fair tax and employee share ownership</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	9/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neil Gray</p>
			<p>That this House supports employee share ownership and believes that such schemes reward loyalty and hard work by giving employees a real stake in their company with tax breaks; commends the Social Market Foundation's report entitled Strengthening Employee Ownership in the UK; notes that the Roadchef Employee Benefits Trust, the first tax exempt all-employee share ownership scheme of its kind in the UK approved by the then UK Government and HMRC, was missed from the list of all-employee share ownership schemes that currently benefit from tax breaks under existing legislation because it was stripped of its assets by Roadchef's former CEO in breach of trust; further notes that Trustees subsequently recovered compensation from HMRC and the former CEO but are prevented from distributing this vital money to approximately 4,000 beneficiaries, mainly low-paid former and current cleaning and catering staff of Roadchef, because HMRC are still considering what taxes to charge the Trust and its beneficiaries; believes this dispute could be swiftly resolved by correcting existing legislation to add the Trust to the list of all-employee share ownership schemes and to ensure that schemes of this nature do not lose their tax exempt status where the trustee has restored monies to the Trust following a breach of trust as in the Roadchef case; and calls on the UK Government to propose an amendment to existing legislation in the Finance Bill to ensure that beneficiaries under the Roadchef scheme are exempt from tax as intended by previous Labour and Conservative Governments and to expedite payouts quickly.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Law</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates Dundee&#8217;s McManus Galleries following their victory in the Scotland&#8217;s Best Visitor Attraction category at the 2020 Scottish Thistle Awards; celebrates the more than 150 years that the McManus Galleries have been welcoming people from the local area and beyond through their doors; further celebrates that more than 1.7 million people have visited the McManus Galleries since they re-opened after their renovation in 2010; and wishes all staff at the McManus Galleries all the best for the future.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Brendan O'Hara</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the remarkable achievement of the staff, pupils and parents of Clachan primary school in being awarded their seventh Green Flag for their commitment to making their school, their village, Argyll and Bute, Scotland and the wider world a cleaner, healthier and safer place for everyone; notes that their achievement  is even more remarkable given that Clachan Primary School has a roll of just five pupils named Matilda Moller, Grace Norris, Lewis Gray, Zephyr Moller and Lachlan Gray; commends the outstanding work done by head teacher Mrs Lucy Blake and class teacher Mrs Lesley Kean in encouraging such an active interest in the environment among their pupils; and recognises the unwavering support the people of Clachan give to the children and their local village school and wishes everyone connected with Clachan Primary School all the very best for the future.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Gregory Campbell</p>
			<p>That this House notes that Wednesday 11 of March is No Smoking Day 2020 and thanks the British Heart Foundation for continuing to highlight this as a focal point for people to begin their journey to stop smoking; further notes that according to the World Health Organisation, tobacco kills half of its users; celebrates with those who have made the decision in previous years to quit resulting in 1.5 billion fewer cigarettes being smoked in the last 9 years alone; and encourages those who wish to stop smoking to use this as their focal point and the day to get the hope and support from their GP, family and friends to make this life changing decision.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the decision by Barclay's Bank on 3 February 2020 to close three branches in Ballymena, Belfast and Newtownards from 29 May 2020; asserts that there is no acceptable rationale for closure of three branches in three major towns and cities in Northern Ireland on the basis of this being part of a sustainability campaign for the banks customers; calls on the bank to reverse this decision immediately and to provide on-street services for its customers in Northern Ireland; further notes the timing of the statement coincided with a public announcement that the bank's Chief Executive Jes Staley faces a probe over historical links to convicted abuser Jeffrey Epstein and seeks assurances this was not a public relations manoeuvre to get bad news out on a bad day; and calls on all interested parties to compel Barclays to rescind its decision.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the formal opinion on a sustainable and inclusive wellbeing economy, adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on 24 January 2020; recognises that this opinion is the last one developed with the 24 UK members of the EESC and thanks them for their contributions; further welcomes the EESC&#8217;s call for a new vision of prosperity for people and planet based on the principles of environmental sustainability, the right to a decent life, and the protection of social values; notes that the EESC highlights that the pursuit of GDP growth ignores important elements of individual and social wellbeing and fails to account properly for environmental and social considerations;  welcomes the call for a precautionary approach so that macroeconomic stability does not depend on GDP growth; further welcomes the call for new indicators of economic performance and social progress; and calls on the UK Government and HM Treasury in particular to at least match the ambition and leadership shown by the EESC by conducting a review of the growth dependency of the UK economy and to develop a comprehensive strategy to transition to a wellbeing economy that protects and restores ecosystems and biodiversity, reduces inequality, fosters sustainable entrepreneurship and delivers a just transition to a climate neutral way of life for all UK citizens.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the international campaign Sack the Sachet by A Plastic Planet, which seeks to end the world&#8217;s reliance on single-use sachets that are so damaging to the environment; notes that globally 855 billion sachets are thrown away every year, enough to wrap the entire surface of the planet or, if placed end to end, stretch to the moon 189 times; further notes that the figure could reach one trillion by 2030; acknowledges that those sachets are almost exclusively made of plastic and are single-use items that will end up in landfill, in incinerators or directly in our natural environments; highlights that those sachets are used for a range of purposes such as condiments, toiletries and washing powder, despite all of those items having reusable and more environmentally friendly alternatives; and calls on the Government as well as hon. Members to work together to end the scourge of the plastic sachet and help build a more sustainable planet.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that community language services help provide young people with an understanding of their first language and culture, raise educational attainment, celebrate diversity and linguistic plurality, and promote social cohesion across communities; is concerned that, at a time when many are worried about knife crime, radicalisation and the lack of a sense of belonging that many young people feel, these services are being cut and privatised; regrets that local government and the vital public services they provide have been undermined by Government cuts, leading to the loss of key services, such as community language services; and calls on the Government to ensure that the local and public provision of community language services is free at the point of use.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK&#8217;s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering &#163;100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>
