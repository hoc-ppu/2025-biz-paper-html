			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	10/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern regarding the treatment of refugees in Greece and at that country's border with Turkey, the deterioration of conditions in refugee camps and the escalating violence towards refugees, journalists and aid workers in Greece; is profoundly concerned by the actions of the Greek authorities, including firing tear gas and repelling dinghies, and the decision of the Greek Government to temporarily suspend the registration of asylum claims which violates Greece&#8217;s responsibilities under the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees; is deeply troubled by the EU's use of dehumanising language, support for the Greek Government&#8217;s hostile approach to refugees, and failure to take its fair share of responsibility for refugees; notes refugees are entitled to seek safety in Europe under international and EU law; calls on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to urge their counterparts in European governments to respect international law, ensure all asylum seekers have access to fair and effective asylum procedures, and stop unlawful border control practices, such as pushbacks, collective expulsions and unlawful return; further notes with concern that the number of child refugees brought to the UK through the Vulnerable Children&#8217;s Resettlement scheme is reported to have dropped by 30 per cent in 2019 and that the Government removed the commitment to work with the EU to resettle child refugees from the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill; and urges the UK Government to work with other European governments to quickly relocate asylum seekers currently located on the Greek islands, including via family and humanitarian visas.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patrick Grady</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates Pinar Aksu on her selection as the Scotland winner of the Amnesty International UK Brave awards in recognition of her work to end immigration detention of children; understands that she has campaigned against detention since she was 15 years old after personal experience of detention as a child and now works with the Maryhill Integration Network in Glasgow; further understands that the Amnesty Brave Awards ran for the first time this year, supported by the People&#8217;s Postcode Lottery, with the aim of recognising activists around the UK for their work as Human Rights Defenders; notes that activists Elena Soper, Laura Pasternak, Nagineh Azar, Roza Salih, Remzije Sherifi and Beth Morrison all received special mentions from Amnesty for their work in Scotland, and four other winners were named from around the UK including Climate activist Anna Kernahan, disability advocate Dermot Devlin, and North Korea campaigner Jihyun Park; and wishes all the winners, nominees and all those recognised by these awards all the best for the future.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patrick Grady</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the work of FemEng in Malawi, a pioneering student project led by a group of female engineers from the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Malawi University of Science and Technology; understands that this collaborative project works to empower women in engineering and promote STEM subjects through a range of workshops designed to showcase the various engineering applications to children in Malawi; notes that the team is made up of eight students from the University of Glasgow and twelve from the Malawi University of Science and Technology who are studying a range of engineering courses including mechanical, chemical, biomedical, product design, materials and manufacturing; further notes that the Glasgow team will travel to Malawi for a period of three to four weeks this summer in order to develop and deliver STEM workshops to the local community and the surrounding area; and wishes everyone associated with the project every success this summer and for the future.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	10/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jack Dromey</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges recent research conducted by YouGov which demonstrates that 62 per cent of parents believe there is too much standardised assessment in primary schools in England; notes that parents consider the happiness of pupils and a well-rounded education to be a better measure of the performance of schools than formal tests taken under exam conditions; further notes that teaching to the test can limit children's access to a broad and balanced curriculum and restrict time spent on activities which children would find stimulating and challenging; further expresses concern that the pressure of sitting tests under exam conditions can harm pupils' well-being and have negative consequences both in school and at home; and calls for an urgent Government review of all assessment in primary schools to achieve a system of standardised accountability which is in line with parents' priorities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">James Daly</p>
			<p>That this House recognises JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Sports) as a leading UK retailer and one of the largest private sector employers in the North West, including 4,000 staff at its Bury headquarters; notes JD Sports merger with Footasylum plc, the Rochdale based retailer, which the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is proposing to unwind on competition grounds and in doing so, deliver an uncertain future for the 2,500 staff and 70 stores of Footasylum across the UK at a time of retail sector fragility; expresses deep concern that the CMA has failed to understand the dynamic and highly competitive nature of retail in the UK today, evident to shoppers on high streets in towns and cities, along with those shopping on their devices across the UK, and that the CMA has instead relied on ill-suited methods of analysis including traditional surveys outside stores; notes that Footasylum is only a small market player which the CMA itself recognises as having a market share of around 5 per cent; urges the CMA to consider all evidence provided by all parties, including JD Sports, demonstrating that the acquisition of Footasylum is pro-competitive and pro-consumer; and calls on the Government to take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that the CMA does not fail consumers or Footasylum staff by rigidly sticking to ill-suited methods of analysis and a limited evidential base, whilst protecting jobs and supporting the economy in the North West.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	10/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr David Davis</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to level up; notes that a co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to creating the conditions for good work across the country will be necessary to achieve this goal; recognises research by the Institute for the Future of Work that shows people across the country are experiencing an increased sense of economic insecurity associated with automation; further notes that incentivising the adoption of technology and automation will be required to boost regional growth; notes that a collaborative approach to managing automation and the transition of people into new good jobs is therefore crucial; calls on the Government to initiate a Work 5.0 Strategy involving the Treasury and Departments of Education, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Work and Pensions and Health and Social Care to advance socially responsible automation across the UK; and seeks a commitment and dedicated budget for a collaborative process to develop this strategy.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kate Osborne</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Liz Saville Roberts</span><span class="signatory">Mike Hill</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that community language services help provide young people with an understanding of their first language and culture, raise educational attainment, celebrate diversity and linguistic plurality, and promote social cohesion across communities; is concerned that, at a time when many are worried about knife crime, radicalisation and the lack of a sense of belonging that many young people feel, these services are being cut and privatised; regrets that local government and the vital public services they provide have been undermined by Government cuts, leading to the loss of key services, such as community language services; and calls on the Government to ensure that the local and public provision of community language services is free at the point of use.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">215</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Safe inside prisons charter</h3>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mike Hill</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with alarm the record-high levels of violence against prison staff, with over 10,000 reported annual assaults compared with less than 3,000 a decade ago; welcomes the new Safe Inside Prisons Charter launched by the Joint Unions in Prisons Alliance, a coalition of nine national trades unions representing the majority of staff working in prisons; believes that the Charter's proposed single reporting system for violence, accessible both internally and externally so staff can report incidents away from the workplace, represents the kind of common-sense solution so badly needed to tackle the health and safety emergency in our prisons; and calls on the Government to adopt the Charter immediately and work with the Alliance to help protect the diligent, brave and committed staff that keep our prisons running under the most challenging circumstances.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Paula Barker</span><span class="signatory">Liz Saville Roberts</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919 for its importance as a turning point in the history of the Raj and British Empire in India; notes that the centenary of this event in 2019 was significantly marked in India and still affects relations with the UK; further recognises that the former Prime Minister, David Cameron, referred to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre as a deeply shameful act; further notes that this event does not represent modern British values; urges the Government to ensure that British children are taught about this shameful period and that modern British values welcome the right to peaceful protest; and further urges the Government formally to apologise in the House and inaugurate a memorial day to commemorate this event.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the publication of the UN&#8217;s database of companies operating in Israeli settlements; acknowledges that all Israeli settlements are illegal and that the transfer of a civilian population to an occupied territory is a war crime under international law; notes that complicity in war crimes is a serious criminal offence; reaffirms the Government&#8217;s obligation to uphold international law, and the corporate responsibility of companies to respect human rights, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles; is alarmed that UK businesses are listed in the UN database, while also recognising that the database itself is not exhaustive of all companies supporting illegal settlement infrastructure; welcomes the report of Amnesty International highlighting that companies cannot do business in or with settlements without contributing to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; and calls on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and under customary international humanitarian law, by banning UK trade with illegal settlements and making binding regulations for companies to uphold human rights standards.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that workers in Higher Education (HE) have suffered a 17 per cent pay cut since 2009, a 15.1 per cent gender pay gap and a 26 per cent black and minority ethnic pay gap; further notes that in some Higher Education Institutions, 40 percent of staff are employed on temporary or casual contracts; notes that, according to surveys, university staff work an average of 51 hours per week and that there is an ongoing epidemic of poor mental health in that sector; believes that staff working conditions affect student learning and that this is damaging to both students&#8217; education and the quality and reputation of UK HE; recognises that staff pay and working conditions are a result of the marketisation of HE funding and provision; supports the 14 day industrial action called by the University and College&#8217;s Union (UCU) for fairer pay, gender and BAME equality, more realistic workloads, more equitable pension contributions and an end to casualisation; calls on the employers to take action to address the legitimate concerns of university staff and the ongoing crisis in HE; and further calls on the Government to work with the employers and UCU to resolve that dispute and end the marketisation of the sector.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights that it is unacceptable that in 2020 women and girls pay more than men for basic products, including toiletries, clothes, and haircuts; notes that products marketed at women are, in some cases, 34 per cent more expensive than those aimed at men; further notes that the unfair price gap will have a significant financial effect on a woman over the course of her life; regrets that women are subject to the additional injustice of the gender pay gap, which sees 8 out of 10 companies still paying more to their male employees; commends companies that have adjusted their pricing and decreased the price of some of their razors so that they are more aligned with the price of men&#8217;s razors and encourages other companies to follow suit; notes the Government&#8217;s failure to support the Gender-based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill 2017-19; and calls on the Government to end the discriminatory Pink Tax by supporting the forthcoming Private Members&#8217; Bill to be tabled by the hon.

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK&#8217;s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering &#163;100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>

			<p>That this House notes press reports that rugby union's Six Nations tournament could be put behind a TV pay wall after decades on free to air public broadcasting services; believes the annual tournament should be placed in the Government's Category A of sporting events which must be made available live on free-to-air platforms; recognises that the Six Nations, which began in 1883 as the Home Nations, is one of the oldest and most historic sports tournaments in the world with a special place in the sporting and social culture of Ireland, Scotland, England and particularly Wales; notes the large TV audiences which this year's tournament has already attracted on terrestrial TV with a peak of seven million viewers watching the opening weekend's fixtures accounting for an audience share of 41 per cent; considers the generations of young people who have been inspired to take up the sport after watching the tournament on terrestrial television; and calls on all interested parties to ensure that the Six Nations remains on free to air TV.</p>

			<p>That this House celebrates Commonwealth Day and the shared goals and bonds between Commonwealth nations, but regrets that half a million UK pensioners living overseas in so-called frozen countries, of which over 90 per cent are Commonwealth nations, are suffering unfairly because the value of their pension is frozen and not up-rated annually in line with inflation, plunging thousands of UK pensioners including veterans and former public servants into poverty; and calls on the Government to uprate the pensions of all UK pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p>That this House urges the Government to introduce legislation to ban the imports and sales of real fur products; notes that the UK has long banned the main methods of fur so-called production, namely leg-hold trapping and fur factory farming, due to their inherent cruelty; believes that, in view of these bans, it is hypocritical to continue to allow the import of real fur; further notes that the fur industry in the UK has significantly declined over the last 40 years, is now rejected by the majority of global fashion houses and UK high street retailers, and that fur sales are soon to be banned in California; acknowledges that there is a political and legal opportunity for a fur ban with the UK leaving the European Union; further acknowledges that there is widespread public support for a fur ban; and further believes that a fur ban is a natural extension of the existing import bans on cat and dog fur and commercial seal products, and that a comprehensive fur ban will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the promotion of animal welfare.</p>

			<p>That this House supports employee share ownership and believes that such schemes reward loyalty and hard work by giving employees a real stake in their company with tax breaks; commends the Social Market Foundation's report entitled Strengthening Employee Ownership in the UK; notes that the Roadchef Employee Benefits Trust, the first tax exempt all-employee share ownership scheme of its kind in the UK approved by the then UK Government and HMRC, was missed from the list of all-employee share ownership schemes that currently benefit from tax breaks under existing legislation because it was stripped of its assets by Roadchef's former CEO in breach of trust; further notes that Trustees subsequently recovered compensation from HMRC and the former CEO but are prevented from distributing this vital money to approximately 4,000 beneficiaries, mainly low-paid former and current cleaning and catering staff of Roadchef, because HMRC are still considering what taxes to charge the Trust and its beneficiaries; believes this dispute could be swiftly resolved by correcting existing legislation to add the Trust to the list of all-employee share ownership schemes and to ensure that schemes of this nature do not lose their tax exempt status where the trustee has restored monies to the Trust following a breach of trust as in the Roadchef case; and calls on the UK Government to propose an amendment to existing legislation in the Finance Bill to ensure that beneficiaries under the Roadchef scheme are exempt from tax as intended by previous Labour and Conservative Governments and to expedite payouts quickly.</p>

			<p>That this House celebrates International Women's Day which took place on Sunday March 8; recognises the importance of marking the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women; reaffirms its commitment to promoting gender equality; notes with sadness that the subjugation and persecution of women and girls remains a global phenomenon; laments the fact that many women in the world are persecuted for both their gender and their faith, such as Yazidi women in Iraq or Hindu and Christian girls forcibly converted and married in Pakistan; believes that the UK government can play an important role in addressing the specific vulnerabilities experienced by women from religious minority communities around the world; calls on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development to recognise these specific vulnerabilities; and urges the UK Government to include targeted programming and aid for women who face double vulnerabilities as members of minority faith communities, include religion as a factor of vulnerability in any assessment made in planning and programming and ensure that sensitivity relating to the international right to freedom of religion or belief is integrated into gender-related and anti-discrimination programmes.</p>
