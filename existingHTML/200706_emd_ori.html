			<p>This House calls on the Government to extend the school meals vouchers scheme over the summer; notes with concern research by the Food Foundation which found that parents of two million children have experienced food insecurity and that 200,000 children have missed lunch because their family could not access help during lockdown; notes with further concern that foodbanks have been inundated by parents unable to get free school meal support; welcomes the decision by the Welsh Assembly to extend their equivalent scheme to the summer holidays and calls on the Government to do the same in England; further notes that the school meals vouchers scheme is open to 1.3 million pupils and should be made more accessible to increase take-up; believes that by continuing this scheme it will enhance the health, development and well-being of pupils who would benefit the most, as well as provide much-needed additional financial support to the thousands of parents who have been negatively affected by the impact of covid-19, especially at a time when other Government support is withdrawn; and believes that the Government should act to prevent further inequality and reduction in education and life chances for children.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that currently in the UK there are an unknown number of persons who are not UK citizens, who do not have leave to remain in this country, who lack any entitlement to support from the state, who are therefore entirely without funds to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families and who are unable to comply with Government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing; and considers it essential that the Government takes immediate action to ensure that leave to remain in the UK is granted to all such persons who are within the UK but are not citizens, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status, so that they can access healthcare, food and housing to enable them to adhere to Government advice on social distancing, ensure the health of themselves and their families and help protect the health of all people in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that as at 21 June 2020, 1.1 Million employers and 9.2 Million Jobs were being supported through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at a cost of £22.9 Billion; notes with grave concern the effect on whole swathes of the economy of the scheduled cessation of the scheme on 31st October; notes the immoral situation of employers using the Job Retention Scheme to consult on making jobs redundant, in many cases permanently and in others to rehire staff on inferior wages, terms and conditions; further notes that the Government does not measure how many firms are engaged in such behaviour; urges the Government to remove an arbitrary cut-off date for the Job Retention Scheme and to provide significant support to critically affected sectors to avoid widespread job losses, to immediately assess the effect of firms misusing the scheme to cover costs during redundancy consultation periods, to commit to providing regular updates on those matters, to bring forward legislative proposals to close loopholes which enable unscrupulous employers to benefit from the Job Retention Scheme whilst reducing jobs and attacking employees’ wages, terms and conditions.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that as a result of measures taken to halt the spread of covid-19, live performances have been unable to take place; further notes that live music events have all but ceased to exist and as a consequence, many performers and those providing light and sound services have had no income during the covid-19 lockdown; expresses great concern that, without urgent additional Government support, many performers and the companies that support them face imminent financial ruin; and calls on Government to put together an urgent package of support to enable live performances to survive.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges the publication of a report into the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers by Philip Taylor, Professor of Work and Employment Studies, at the University of Strathclyde; recognises that the report raises concerns about unsafe working environments at many call centres including poor social distancing measures, hot-desking, poor cleansing and a lack of remote or home-working options; notes that the report records concerning levels of anxiety and fear among call-centre staff regarding their risk of catching or transferring covid-19 in their workplace; further notes that the report considers the matter to be as much a public health concern as an occupational health issue due to the risk of call centre workers spreading infection; appreciates that, while the document is focused on Scotland, the content and recommendations are equally applicable to the rest of the UK; further recognises that the report makes a number of recommendations including evacuating problematic workplaces, facilitating greater homeworking, auditing call centres and the implementation of appropriate health and safety and testing measures; and calls on the Government to reflect on the evidence and recommendations in that report and consider what actions it can take to help protect call centre workers throughout the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jonathan Edwards</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House believes that the decision to reinstate benefit sanctions in the middle of a health and economic crisis is a profoundly callous step; further believes that this is an ideologically driven, punitive measure which simply adds to the stress and anxiety for people who are already facing hard times; notes that removing benefits and forcing people to use food banks to feed their families does nothing to help anyone back to work; and urgently calls on the Government to extend the suspension of sanctions as the covid-19 crisis continues and the numbers claiming universal credit soar, with a view to scrapping benefit sanctions altogether.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that it has been one year since the all-party Parliamentary group on Terminal Illness published its report on the legal definition of terminal illness; condemns the rules of the Department for Work and Pensions which mean that benefits are only fast-tracked if a terminally ill person has a diagnosis of six months or less to live; recognises that the Scottish Government has committed to ruling out the six month rule when it takes over the personal independence payment; and urges the Government to do the same.</p>
