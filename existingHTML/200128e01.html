			<p>That this House welcomes the Catholic Church&#8217;s focus on Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities for Racial Justice Sunday on 9 February 2020; recognises the valuable contribution that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities make to the Church and to wider society; notes with concern that over three-quarters of people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities have experienced hate speech or hate crimes; further notes that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities experience the worst health, education and employment outcomes of any ethnic group; and calls on the Government to take urgent action to address the discrimination and inequalities these communities face. </p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kim Johnson</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that an estimated 60 per cent of recipients of homecare and 70 per cent of care home residents live with dementia; acknowledges that dementia is a condition caused by diseases of the brain with complex support needs that should be met by the NHS, like any other health condition; recognises that the typical cost of dementia care of &#163;100,000 can be financially devastating for individuals and families; welcomes the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society&#8217;s proposal for a Dementia Fund as a financial injection into the social care system in the short-to-medium term, allowing for greater provision of safe and quality care for people with dementia, longer visits for people with dementia and savings to the NHS; believes that this could be financed through unallocated funding for community and preventative support in the NHS Long Term Plan; and urges the Government to include a Dementia Fund in the forthcoming Budget to break the deadlock on reforming the social care system and end the unfairness facing people with dementia, as well as supporting Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK&#8217;s Delivering the Dementia Moonshot report recommendations to find cures and treatments for all forms of dementia.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mohammad Yasin</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kim Johnson</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises with concern the widespread funding and staffing shortfall in social care services; welcomes the commitment in all major party manifestos to seek reform of the social care sector; notes the significant challenges an ageing population poses for local authorities and the NHS; further recognises the significant increase in need for services for working age adults; further notes the important role social care services play in helping citizens live independently and with dignity whilst providing early intervention to prevent more serious health problems; notes the need for a parity of esteem between NHS services and social care services and recognises the critical role local care services have to play in supporting the health service; further notes the significant work that has already been done to seek cross party consensus on the future of social care; calls on the Government urgently to bring forward the development of firm and detailed proposals on a cross-party basis for a fair and sustainable funding settlement to ensure the sustainable long term provision of social care services to enable everyone who needs social care to access the support they need and to live with dignity.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">71</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Outsourcing of TfL Underground and Overground cleaners</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/01/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	15</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sarah Owen</span><span class="signatory">Clive Lewis</span><span class="signatory">Kim Johnson</span></p>
			<p>That this House pays tribute to cleaners employed on London Underground and Overground who keep the capital's transport network clear of obstructions, and maintain it in a hygienic state while working unsocial hours in dirty and hazardous conditions; notes that Transport for London continues to use outsourcing companies ABM and Vinci to employ cleaners on London Underground and the Overground rail network; notes with concern that a recent RMT survey of ABM cleaners revealed that the overwhelming majority struggle to make ends meet on low pay, have far worse working conditions than directly employed staff and believe that ABM puts profits ahead of passenger and staff concerns; further notes that the overwhelming majority of cleaners want to be directly employed and brought in-house and believe that bringing all cleaning staff on London's Underground and Overground network in-house will help improve working conditions for this vulnerable group of workers, improve the quality of service for passengers and represent greater economy and efficiency; and urges the Mayor of London to commit to bringing these workers in-house and to convene a working group with the RMT union and other stakeholders to discuss how this can be achieved.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates those who took part in the march of 11 January 2020 in Glasgow in support of Scottish independence; commends the resolute determination of the marchers who braved horrendous weather to make their voices heard; understands that it was estimated that tens of thousands of people participated in the march; respects that these citizens were asserting the nation of Scotland's right to decide to choose its own future; recognises that this follows on from the election of more than 80 per cent of Scotland's MPs standing on a manifesto calling for Scotland's future to be in Scotland's hands; understands that for the first time in history Members elected from the two principal countries within the UK have different constitutional mandates for their respective countries; is mindful of the fact that any denial of the democratic will of the people of Scotland in seeking to determine their own future contradicts principles of equality and ignores the Claim of Right for Scotland, that the people of Scotland have the sovereign right to determine the form of government best suited to their needs; appreciates that this right is well established and was most recently endorsed by the House of Commons in July 2018; and asserts that all attempts to ignore the democratic will of the Scottish people to choose their own future are unsustainable.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Conor McGinn</span><span class="signatory">Mr Barry Sheerman</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that the Mental Health Act will be reformed; agrees that current legislation is out of step with a modern mental healthcare system and that people must have a service that affords them the dignity and respect that they deserve; further notes that the announcement made no mention of the urgent needs of children; contends that unless their needs are embedded into a new Mental Health Act as a central priority such legislation will be fundamentally flawed; calls on the Government to guarantee that new mental health legislation will focus on children&#8217;s needs and protect them, ensure that services are provided by a properly qualified workforce and reflect policies that are informed by the best available evidence; and further calls on the Government to focus on the needs of parents and carers and guarantee to bring forward such legislative proprosals at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Brendan O'Hara</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates the life and work of Federico Fellini on the centenary of his birth on 20 January 1920; recognises that Fellini remains one of the pre-eminent auteurs of Italian, European and World cinema; notes that his inimitable and immediately recognisable style influences the visual arts today as much as it did with the release of his directorial debut, I Vitelloni, in 1953; advises that hon. and Rt. hon. Members to watch La Dolce Vita, an iconic love letter to his adopted city of Rome; and notes that Fellini&#8217;s directorial breadth went further to include surrealist and semi-autobiographical masterpieces including 8&#189; and Roma which unpicked the social, religious and sexual mores of the era in which Italy redefined itself as an open and vibrant democracy at the heart of European culture.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the positive interventions from many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions; welcomes the equalisation of retirement ages between women and men; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory employment and pension laws; recognises that this included being excluded from some pensions schemes; recognises that this had the negative effect for them of losing the opportunity to have the same level of pension as their partner or spouse; further recognises that this has had the consequence of women in this position never being able to have equal pensions to men; further notes that this has negatively and profoundly impacted on them including increased poverty, deteriorating health and homelessness; notes that at least 3.8 million women have been impacted by the loss of their pensions from the age of 60 in three separate age hikes; and calls on the Government to enact a temporary special measure as permitted by international law to provide restitution to women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions from the age of 60 because of the impact of the rise in retirement age.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kim Johnson</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that strategic rail infrastructure is critical to the long-term success of the UK and all of its parts; believes that after decades of under-investment in strategic rail infrastructure High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and Midlands Engine Rail delivered in full represent a once in a generation chance to transform connectivity, attract investment, boost skills and opportunity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands and will benefit the rest of the UK; further believes that transforming rail capacity and connectivity in the North and Midlands will create economic growth, improve productivity, boost jobs and skills, increase prosperity and support a transition to a low-carbon economy; and calls on the Government to deliver High Speed 2 in full and recognise this once in a generation opportunity to transform rail capacity and connectivity and level-up communities across the North and Midlands.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around &#163;10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to &#163;10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid &#163;728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of &#163;9.30 per hour (&#163;10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to use all diplomatic and economic measures at its disposal to influence the Indian and Pakistan Governments to ensure that democracy is respected and that the Kashmiri people are at the heart of any constitutional reform of the region, including respecting both the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, particularly UNSCR 47 which refers to the people of Jammu and Kashmir having the right to self-determination and the 1972 Simla Agreement which refers to the future of Jammu and Kashmir being determined by peaceful means; and urges the Government to use all international fora to press for the rule of law in Kashmir to be upheld and human rights protected by lifting the telecommunications black out and allowing independent, international observers to the region as well as supporting the assistance of a UN Special Envoy for Kashmir in facilitating a peaceful and sustainable future for Kashmir.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that UK homes are amongst the least energy efficient in Europe, with low energy efficiency and high energy costs being particularly problematic in rural areas; acknowledges that living in fuel poverty causes significant hardship and suffering; accepts the link between fuel poverty and increased winter mortality; recognises the determined efforts by the Scottish Government to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty in Scotland through the Warmer Homes Scotland initiative and the availability of Home Energy Scotland loans; welcomes Government initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty through schemes such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) but is concerned that the lack of funding and how it is funded needs more consideration; appreciates that more work is needed to help householders pay their bills, increase energy security, stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change; remains concerned about the failings in oversight associated with the Government&#8217;s Green Deal which resulted in thousands of householders being mis-sold government-backed energy efficiency measures, with consumer concerns persisting about Home Energy and Lifestyle Management Systems (HELMS); appreciates that such cases erode consumer confidence in government-backed energy efficiency schemes; notes with concern complaints about sales techniques and poor workmanship of companies engaged under the ECO; and calls on the Government to review and monitor the oversight of such schemes to ensure they are as robust as they can be, with sufficient protections in place for householders in which they can have full confidence.</p>
