			<p>That this House believes every penny spent on NHS privatisation and outsourcing is a penny less spent on patient care; recognises the urgent need to fully repeal the Health and Social Care Act 2012, reinstate the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to provide a free, comprehensive, universal healthcare system, and end the requirement on health authorities to put services out to competitive tender; accepts the undisputed accuracy of the information on that matter contained within the UK-US Trade and Investment Working Group documents which cover meetings that took place between 2017 and 2018 and came to light during the 2019 general election campaign; affirms that insurance based health service systems, such as in the US, leave many millions without healthcare and are more expensive and less efficient than the UK’s NHS; and acknowledges that the NHS must not be on the table in any negotiations for a trade deal between the UK and United States and that such a development would risk paving the way for a US style health insurance system in the UK, significantly to the detriment of the health and well-being of the UK population.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p>That this House recognises that workers in some UK garment factories are suffering under exploitative labour practices, underpayment of legal minimum wages and unsafe working conditions; acknowledges the need to take urgent action to protect such workers from exploitation and ensure that factory owners are meeting all legal obligations; notes that taking action would prevent rogue factories from undercutting compliant businesses and would encourage retailers to source more clothing from the UK, supporting the development of an ethical, world-leading UK fashion industry; and therefore calls on the Government to implement the British Retail Consortium’s proposal for a Fit to Trade licensing scheme for all garment factories in the UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Edward Davey</p>
			<p>That this House condemns the Government’s cruel universal credit assessment period regulations which result in people who are paid every four weeks rather than every calendar month being penalised; notes that as a result of those regulations the Department for Work and Pensions sometimes disqualifies an individual from receiving universal credit which can also lead to the local authority ceasing to provide some means of support; expresses its concern that those who wish to appeal the decision have to go through a lengthy mandatory reconsideration process; further notes with regret that 85,000 people are currently estimated to be affected by that mandatory reconsideration process; welcomes the recent Court of Appeal ruling that those regulations are unlawful; and calls on the Government to urgently bring forward measures to fix the broken welfare system.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the Government has repeatedly misrepresented consultation of the development sector on the Department for International Development&apos;s response to the covid-19 crisis as equating a formal mechanism for consultation on the DFID-FCO merger or Integrated Review; further notes that consultation on the UK’s international covid-19 response has never been a formal mechanism for consultation on wider government policy; and calls on the Government to urgently commit to meaningful engagement and consultation with the development sector on the new Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and the strategy that defines it (the Integrated Review) so that aid and development expertise informs the new department’s structure and priorities and that poverty reduction and sustainable development remain UK aid&apos;s primary objectives.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that the events industry is worth £70 billion annually to the UK comprising conferences, exhibitions, weddings, arts and culture, festivals and shows, music and sporting events; expresses concern that unlike some parts of the hospitality sector little has been done to allow the events industry to reopen following the covid19 pandemic; believes that many of the 700,000 jobs in the industry are imminently at risk, including many independent contractors excluded from Government rescue packages to date and up to 25,000 small businesses; notes that much of the events industry is uniquely placed to incorporate social distancing and track and trace into its operations and has already developed a Safer Events Framework for Action to manage future risk; further notes that most European countries have reopened their events industries and that many postponed events have a lead-in time of six to nine months to reorganise; and therefore calls on the Government to set a timetable for reopening, to support the industry in its recovery period and to work with the Association of Event Organisers and other industry representatives to restore this vital part of the UK economy.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to provide vital funding for universities that are under mass financial strain; notes this is not an unexpected side effect from the covid-19 outbreak, but that the outbreak has worsened pre-existing problems resulting from a lack of financial Government support of higher education and the marketisation of education; further notes that thirteen universities, as found by the ISF, will face bankruptcy without a Government bail-out; recognises that SOAS University, the only higher education institution in the UK specialising in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, is currently facing a mass restructuring as a result of long term financial strain that has worsened with the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take action to provide essential support for those institutions.</p>
