			<p class="MotionSponsor">Robert Halfon</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) on its coherent response to the coronavirus crisis which has been compounded by massive falls in oil prices and continuing political crisis in the rest of Iraq; urges the UK Government and others to respond as generously as possible to the KRG&#8217;s requests for assistance with medical supplies to tackle the virus; and believes that the traditional resilience of the Kurdistani people will once again ensure they weather these crises.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that there are over 4.9 million self-employed workers in the UK contributing over &#163;275 billion to the UK economy; welcomes the Federation of Small Businesses&#8217; #ThinkSelfEmployed campaign to raise awareness of the current lack of provision for these workers in the Government&#8217;s fiscal package to tackle the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic; commends those self-employed people who have taken part in the #ThinkSelfEmployed campaign to make their needs known to the Government; welcomes the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#8217;s pledge to the self-employed that help is coming; recognises however that many self-employed workers are already out of pocket and that the utmost urgency is therefore required in the Government&#8217;s response; calls on the Government to give a degree of certainty to the self-employed on when this help will come; and further calls on the Government to heed the calls from the Scottish Cabinet Secretaries for Finance and for Economy, Fair Work and Culture to expand the jobs retention scheme to cover the self-employed and widen access to statutory sick pay to the self-employed.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	24/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>
			<p>That this House commends the Government&#8217;s measures to support businesses and employees during the covid-19 outbreak; notes however that those measures still leave the country&#8217;s 5 million self-employed people with no reliable safety net; further notes that one in four people in South Lakeland is self-employed; recognises that each day the Government fails to act many of those people get closer to having irreparable damage inflicted on their livelihoods; and calls on the Government to create a Self-Employed Income Guarantee that will be effective immediately with the Government guaranteeing self-employed people 80 per cent of their average incomes over the last three years up to a cap of &#163;35,000.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Fiona Bruce</p>
			<p>That this House notes with profound concern the ongoing breaches by China and its controlled regime in Hong Kong of basic principles of human rights and specifically of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong; welcomes the commitment by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to develop a regime for the introduction of Magnitsky-style sanctions to enable it to target those who sanction and cause abuses of human rights overseas; looks forward to the urgent publication of the proposed regime; and encourages the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to begin now to identify those senior members of the Hong Kong Police Force and of the governing Administration of Hong Kong who have approved and permitted its brutal response to what were initially peaceful expressions of legitimate protest so that sanctions can be promptly implemented against them.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Peter Bottomley</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises International Bagpipe Day on March 10, a day initiated by the Bagpipe Society to celebrate the diversity of the world&#8217;s bagpiping traditions and promote this historic instrument to new players around the globe; notes that over 130 different kinds of pipes are played worldwide, with the earliest pipe carvings reported on Middle Eastern Hittite Stones dating from 1000 BC; celebrates the vibrancy of bagpiping traditions across Scotland with talented local pipe bands such as Glencorse in Midlothian making sure this distinctive and powerful sound continues to inspire audiences across the generations; and supports calls for a bagpipe emoji to be established on social media sites to recognise the universal appeal of this ancient, iconic instrument.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges that over 2,000 EU citizens living in Midlothian have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living and working in the UK; recognises the enormous contribution that EU citizens make to the cultural and economic fabric of the UK every day; further recognises Scotland&#8217;s particular reliance on EU citizens, with 26 per cent of small employers in Scotland having at least one EU citizen on the team compared to 21 per cent across the UK; notes with concern the risk that treating settlement in the UK as a privilege rather than a right could have on small businesses in Midlothian as a hub for small business; condemns the EU Settlement Scheme for treating settlement in the UK not as a right but a privilege; further condemns the Home Office for its lack of clarity in providing details of how many EU citizens have been granted settled status and pre-settled status; and recognises that the incompatibility between the Home Office&#8217;s approach to EU citizens and the needs of Scotland further underlines the need for Scotland to pursue an independent future with a more compassionate, open migration system.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">296</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Sir Amyas Morse's review of the Loan Charge</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Peter Bottomley</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the publication of Sir Amyas Morse&#8217;s Loan Charge review and the announcement that the Government will make some amendments to the relevant legislation; notes that loans made before 2010 will no longer be subject to the Loan Charge and that the self-assessment deadline has been delayed until 30 September 2020; believes that people should pay the tax that they owe, but that HMRC failed to work constructively with those seeking a Loan Charge repayment plan, with concerns that some may face bankruptcy or homelessness; demands HMRC review the implementation of this policy to ensure that nobody seeking to make repayment is treated unfairly with undeliverable financial demands; condemns the tax professionals who advised clients to use such loopholes given the importance of people paying their fair share for public services; and urges the Government to pursue the organisations that facilitated these loans.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">297</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Sick pay and the Institute for the Future of Work</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	11</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Allan Dorans</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern that the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardising the work and income as well as the health of many people, including the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts; notes that the Government&#8217;s revised sick pay policy announced in the budget does not expand eligibility for statutory sick pay, and that an estimated 2 million workers would remain excluded and reliant on employment and support allowance or universal credit; further notes that these arrangements and the low level of sick pay, currently just &#163;94.25 per week, will expose many workers and their families to financial hardship and uncertainty; recognises the increased risk to public health this poses as people are forced to remain in the workforce on economic grounds even when this is contrary to public health or medical advice; further recognises the findings of research by the Institute for the Future of Work, which indicates that boosting the statutory floor of protection would support social and economic resilience; calls for emergency legislation to introduce statutory sick pay for all as a contribution to dealing with the worst public health crisis in a generation; and further calls on the Government to initiate cross-departmental work on a policy framework for socially responsible, human-centred employment, including a review of basic statutory protection for the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Patrick Grady</span></p>
			<p>That this House remembers with great sadness that one year ago, on 15 March 2019, 51 people were murdered and many more had their lives changed forever by an act of extreme right terrorism in Christchurch, New Zealand; welcomes the report The Impact of Christchurch Terror Attack by TellMAMA, a national project which records and measures anti-Muslim incidents in the UK; notes that this extremely important and harrowing analysis of the events in Christchurch highlights that the attacks on the mosques in Christchurch had a significant effect in the UK, resulting in a rapid but long-lasting rise in anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia; recognises that the report makes challenging reading for the social media platforms who must now direct their immense resources towards ensuring the removal of unacceptable material from their sites and increased efforts to stop groups from promoting hatred and violence; further recognises that it shouldn't take a tragedy such as the events in Christchurch for society to notice how entrenched racism and islamophobia have become in society and that copycat attacks in the UK and elsewhere across the globe must be a wake-up call for all those committed to fighting hatred.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that there is an urgent need for national action to stave off food insecurity during the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take the following steps to deal with food insecurity: to provide immediate support to all voluntary and mutual-aid organisations currently working to tackle food insecurity in their communities as the private sector has shown itself unable to distribute food in a time of crisis, and thus mutual aid networks have rapidly grown to distribute the resources needed to ensure that communities are effectively supported in the coming weeks; to maximise capacity and stimulate food distribution and essential aid by reducing barriers to accessing food; to grant emergency resources to community support groups to ensure they are funded immediately and maintain their momentum and organisation over the coming weeks; and to protect community spaces during the pandemic and increase access to community and publicly owned kitchen facilities and unused spaces by freezing all rent and bills and making them available for use by community organisations in the distribution of food and resources.</p>

			<p>This House expresses concern at reports that some retailers are inflating the prices of products in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak; notes that the Competition and Markets Authority has urged businesses to behave responsibly and not increase prices in response to the covid-19 crisis; applauds the actions of retailers who have not inflated prices and those that have proactively taken measures to support their customers and local community at this difficult time; believes that while many businesses are striving to do the right thing under very challenging circumstances, the continued behaviour of those seeking to capitalise on the current situation by charging unjustifiably high prices for essential goods is immoral and unjust; and urges the Government to take action to price rises as a matter of urgency.</p>
