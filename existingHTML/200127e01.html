			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the decision taken on 10 January 2020 by the United Nations Security Council to cut back essential humanitarian aid to Northern Syria, a decision which exposes four million people to the prospect of a devastating lack of basic daily food stuffs and medicines; is troubled that two of the four access points to Northern Syria for aid have been closed; notes that all aid will now have to cross through the border with Turkey or direct from Government held areas; further notes that the UN Secretary General has stated that the previous programme of aid to Northern Syria was essential; raises concerns that Kurdish people of Syria will be disproportionately affected because of the policies of the Turkish State towards the Kurdish areas, many of which are now under Turkish occupation; and calls for the United Nations Security Council to reverse this dangerous decision and for all parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, and to broker a negotiated settlement which protects the rights of all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.</p>

			<p>This House welcomes the inauguration of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong to promote democracy and the rule of law, and to defend human rights in Hong Kong, to share information about Hong Kong, and to nurture relations between the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong; notes that the inaugural meeting heard chilling testimony from a consultant surgeon who provides humanitarian aid to those injured in the protests, including police, protestors and bystanders, and who reported having treated the kind of injuries seen in wars; is profoundly concerned by reports of the arrest and public humiliation of those providing medical assistance to the injured; observes that video footage of police brutality demonstrates that the Hong Kong police are failing to adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Guidance on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement; further observes that the arrest of those providing humanitarian assistance is contrary to international law and the global consensus on fundamental human rights of access to medical treatment; is alarmed that failure of the international community to condemn these breaches by the Hong Kong police would set a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, placing in grave jeopardy the lives and welfare of humanitarian aid workers around the world, including providers of medical and other aid from the United Kingdom; and calls on the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to raise these concerns with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises and celebrates the importance of vibrant oceans to our global ecosystem; notes that our oceans are facing a variety of threats, including large amounts of waste of all kinds being disposed of in them, overfishing and human caused climate change, and that the creatures within them are especially vulnerable to even slight changes in global temperatures; regrets that studies have found that only 13 per cent of the ocean has been unharmed by human activity, that 50 per cent of global coral has died since 1980, that 72 marine species are listed as critically endangered, and that over a third of marine mammal species face extinction; recalls the work of the Blue Belt Programme in UK Overseas Territories; welcomes the Greenpeace Ocean Declaration on the ongoing negotiations towards a Global Ocean Treaty and calls upon the Government to be bold in pursuing meaningful negotiations to establish, significantly expand and enforce global ocean sanctuaries, and to drive a global shift towards a collaborative, but also effective, global decision making process to help protect global oceans.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the publication of the Online Harms White Paper in April 2019 and subsequent assurances by the Government that they will introduce a robust regulator to safeguard children online; further notes that over 45,000 people signed the NSPCC&#8217;s Wild West Web petition calling for statutory regulation so that social networks have a legal duty of care to protect every child from abuse online; and notes the urgent need for Government action as data obtained by the NSPCC shows that over the last year an average of 11 child sexual offences occurred each day over just three commonly-used social network platforms; notes that the Home Office estimates that 80,000 adults in the UK poses a sexual threat to children online; recognises that due to the pressing need for change and the time it would take to set up a new regulator that an interim regulator should be appointed to fill the regulatory gap while more long-term measures are being put in place; and calls on the Government to bring in legislation as promised to assign a duty of care regulator to keep children safe online as a matter of urgency, and, in the interim, to support Lord McNally's Private Member's Bill, introduced on 14 January 2020 into the House of Lords, which instructs Ofcom to start preparing for the new regime.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the positive interventions from many hon. Members from across the House on behalf of women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions; welcomes the equalisation of retirement ages between women and men; recalls that women born in the 1950s were subject to discriminatory employment and pension laws; recognises that this included being excluded from some pensions schemes; recognises that this had the negative effect for them of losing the opportunity to have the same level of pension as their partner or spouse; further recognises that this has had the consequence of women in this position never being able to have equal pensions to men; further notes that this has negatively and profoundly impacted on them including increased poverty, deteriorating health and homelessness; notes that at least 3.8 million women have been impacted by the loss of their pensions from the age of 60 in three separate age hikes; and calls on the Government to enact a temporary special measure as permitted by international law to provide restitution to women born in the 1950s who have lost their pensions from the age of 60 because of the impact of the rise in retirement age.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that UK homes are amongst the least energy efficient in Europe, with low energy efficiency and high energy costs being particularly problematic in rural areas; acknowledges that living in fuel poverty causes significant hardship and suffering; accepts the link between fuel poverty and increased winter mortality; recognises the determined efforts by the Scottish Government to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty in Scotland through the Warmer Homes Scotland initiative and the availability of Home Energy Scotland loans; welcomes Government initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty through schemes such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) but is concerned that the lack of funding and how it is funded needs more consideration; appreciates that more work is needed to help householders pay their bills, increase energy security, stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change; remains concerned about the failings in oversight associated with the Government&#8217;s Green Deal which resulted in thousands of householders being mis-sold government-backed energy efficiency measures, with consumer concerns persisting about Home Energy and Lifestyle Management Systems (HELMS); appreciates that such cases erode consumer confidence in government-backed energy efficiency schemes; notes with concern complaints about sales techniques and poor workmanship of companies engaged under the ECO; and calls on the Government to review and monitor the oversight of such schemes to ensure they are as robust as they can be, with sufficient protections in place for householders in which they can have full confidence.</p>
