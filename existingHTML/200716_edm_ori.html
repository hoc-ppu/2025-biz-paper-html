			<p>That this House is concerned about the current provisions provided by the Home Office to support those seeking asylum throughout the pandemic; asks the Government to review the current claiming system and modify it to allow for an asylum claim to be made remotely; demands that the financial support provided by the Government is increased by at least £20 per week to reflect the emergency changes made to the standard rate of universal credit and the increasing prices for essential goods; calls on the Government to review the current accommodation provided to asylum seekers to ensure that all accommodation allows for social distancing and self-isolation to align with the guidance given by the Department for Health and Social Care; and further calls on the Government to provide sufficient cleaning and personal hygiene supplies to prevent the spread of the virus in any shared accommodation.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to discontinue the ability of elected MPs to participate remotely in parliamentary debates, bill committees and by electronic voting is unlawful and discriminatory because it means that up to 250 elected MPs, who are clinically shielded to protect themselves or their families from coronavirus, are no longer able to participate in these activities; further believes that the House of Commons is not empowered to remove the source of its own legitimacy and that the vote to do so was illegal as it excluded the elected MPs affected; calls for the restoration of the democratic rights of all elected MPs who are shielding, and of the constituencies and 15.5 million voters that they represent, to fully participate and for the resumption of virtual arrangements previously in place that continue in the House of Lords, the Senedd and Holyrood; and calls on the Leader of the House of Commons to reinstate the motion allowing online inclusion for shielded elected MPs in all debates and votes, including those on the legal and democratic rights of those elected MPs most affected by the removal of hybrid arrangements; further calls for the resumption of elected MPs’ equal right to work in all aspects of their job, without unreasonable risk to their personal safety, by using the technology available and for the full restoration, without delay, of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament.</p>

			<p>That this House rejects the Prime Minister’s claim on Monday 6 July 2020 that too many care homes didn&apos;t really follow the procedures during the covid-19 outbreak; further notes that during Prime Minister’s Questions on 24 June 2020, the Prime Minister stated that he accepted responsibility for everything that has happened throughout the  crisis; and calls on the Prime Minister to make a public apology for the deep offence his remarks caused to people who lost loved ones and to people who continue to fight covid-19 on the front-line in care homes.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paula Barker</p>
			<p>That this House believes that free bets offered by gambling companies are designed to lock and trap people into gambling as a result of the requirement to provide deposit cash, bank and credit card details and personal details to gain access to those bets; notes that the advertising of free bets encourages people who are addicted to gambling or who cannot afford to gamble; and calls on the Government to implement a ban on the advertising of free bets, and the repetitive pop-up targeting of free bet advertisements online as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the decision to exclude providers of 16-19 education from the Government’s catch-up funding for students after the covid-19 outbreak, notes that 16-19 year olds have missed out on months of their education at a crucial juncture where they would have been sitting exams and preparing to move into higher education, other training or entering the job market; further notes that for those nearing the end of their school career there is very limited time to catch up on the studies they have missed and as such those young people could find their future education, training and job opportunities permanently affected; and calls on the Government to urgently commit to providing catch-up funding for 16-19 education settings at the same level as is being provided for pupils in primary and secondary schools.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the contribution brought about by vehicle safety standards, consumer safety ratings and manufacturing initiatives to reducing death and serious injury in collisions on the UK&apos;s roads over the last 25 years; recognises with concern the scope for potential lowering of vehicle safety standards in negotiations on free trade agreements, particularly with the USA which has lower legislative standards of front and side impact protection and does not require safer car fronts for pedestrian and cyclists in car design; and calls on the Government to ensure that no vehicle is imported to the UK with lower than UK/EU vehicle safety standards.</p>
