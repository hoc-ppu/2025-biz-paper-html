			<p>That this House notes that community language services help provide young people with an understanding of their first language and culture, raise educational attainment, celebrate diversity and linguistic plurality, and promote social cohesion across communities; is concerned that, at a time when many are worried about knife crime, radicalisation and the lack of a sense of belonging that many young people feel, these services are being cut and privatised; regrets that local government and the vital public services they provide have been undermined by Government cuts, leading to the loss of key services, such as community language services; and calls on the Government to ensure that the local and public provision of community language services is free at the point of use.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Kingsbarns distillery whose Dream to Dram whisky was named Best Lowlands Scotch in the 12 years and under category at the World Whiskies Awards in February; notes Kingsbarns&#8217; commitment to using local barley in their production process; further congratulates the distillery which also produces Darnley&#8217;s gin, whose Original Gin was awarded a Silver Medal and whose Spiced Gin received a Bronze in the London Dry Gin Premium category at the International Spirits Challenge in 2019; and celebrates the contribution of distilleries to the economy and community of North East Fife.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wendy Chamberlain</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates CuparNow&#8217;s success at the UK&#8217;s Good Retail Awards for digital impact; notes that the Digital Improvement District model used by the programme is unique; calls upon other communities around the country to adopt similar models; celebrates that CuparNow is backed by businesses and organisations in the town; and commemorates the support which the programme provides to business, culture and tourism, education, health and social care and environmental projects.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carla Lockhart</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p>That this House notes recent reports of the cost to families for young people to perform the role of mascot at top flight Premier League matches; regards some of the charging structures of between &#163;400 and &#163;700 for one game as exceptionally expensive, and calls upon the clubs to review charging so that as many children as possible get the opportunity to meet and lead out their teams at games.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bob Blackman</p>
			<p>That this House extends condolences to the people of Azerbaijan as they commemorate the 28th anniversary of the Khojaly massacre on 26 February 2020; reflects on this atrocity committed against citizens of Azerbaijan amid conflict in the region; and supports calls for a resolution to the conflict, which respects the territory of the Republic, and for the OSCE Minsk Group to increase work, for a peace plan.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Grahame Morris</span><span class="signatory">Rachel Hopkins</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with alarm the record-high levels of violence against prison staff, with over 10,000 reported annual assaults compared with less than 3,000 a decade ago; welcomes the new Safe Inside Prisons Charter launched by the Joint Unions in Prisons Alliance, a coalition of nine national trades unions representing the majority of staff working in prisons; believes that the Charter's proposed single reporting system for violence, accessible both internally and externally so staff can report incidents away from the workplace, represents the kind of common-sense solution so badly needed to tackle the health and safety emergency in our prisons; and calls on the Government to adopt the Charter immediately and work with the Alliance to help protect the diligent, brave and committed staff that keep our prisons running under the most challenging circumstances.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Apsana Begum</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span><span class="signatory">Paula Barker</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that the recent assessment of Transport Focus' National Rail Passenger Survey (NRPS) by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) found that the statistics have the potential to be misrepresented or used misleadingly; further notes that the annual NRPS results are used by the Department for Transport to inform the franchising process, and that further clarity on how this process operates is required for transparency; believes the NRPS methodology should be updated to ensure that it takes passengers' overall satisfaction with an operator into account, rather than measuring satisfaction with one journey only; further believes that it should better address issues around the accessibility of the railway, including engaging with disabled non-users of the railway and specifically asking passengers if they value the presence of station and on-train staff; and calls upon the Government and Transport Focus to meet relevant stakeholders, including trade unions and disability groups, to determine how the NPRS can be updated to more accurately reflect the view and requirements of passengers.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the fact that in March Tyneside cinema is hosting a retrospective of Tony Harrison's film poems and encourages further such retrospectives; recognises that Leeds-born poet Tony Harrison, son of Florrie Horner and baker Harry Ashton Harrison and recipient of the Whitbread Prize for Literature, the European Prize for Literature, the David Cohen Prize for Literature, the PEN Pinter Prize and someone who ruled himself out, on principle, from becoming Poet Laureate and was proud to accept The Leeds Award, not only made poetry his job but became one of the greatest poets in history; notes the incredible range of his poetic work from poems in a myriad of forms including sequences of sonnets to translations, plays, film poems and librettos; admires his life-long quest for a public poetry and his commitment to use his poetic craft to give a hearing to the working-class and victims of war and genocide; believes that establishment criticism of his long poem V, including the 1987 Early Day Motion entitled Television Obscenity, itself showed why that poem, one of the greatest of the 20th century was so necessary and important; believes that his 1998 film poem Prometheus is fit to be ranked alongside the work of Aeschylus and Shelley on the same subject and should be made available as widely as possible; and recognises that throughout his life he has always written, and spoken, for the people.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Virendra Sharma</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 1919 for its importance as a turning point in the history of the Raj and British Empire in India; notes that the centenary of this event in 2019 was significantly marked in India and still affects relations with the UK; further recognises that the former Prime Minister, David Cameron, referred to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre as a deeply shameful act; further notes that this event does not represent modern British values; urges the Government to ensure that British children are taught about this shameful period and that modern British values welcome the right to peaceful protest; and further urges the Government formally to apologise in the House and inaugurate a memorial day to commemorate this event.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Charlotte Nichols</p>
			<p>That this House reaffirms the right of workers to organise collectively into trade unions; stipulates that this right includes workers at London City Airport; notes that a Unite the Union activist, was suspended and had disciplinary proceedings brought against them less than two weeks after the airport received an official request for union recognition in August 2019; recalls that in 2012 an Employment Tribunal found in an interim relief test in London City Airport Ltd v Chacko that another trade union representative had been similarly suspended by City Airport three days after the announcement of a recognition ballot; states that such intimidation is unacceptable; and calls on City Airport to end harassment of trade unionists and enable its workers to decide upon how they wish to be represented.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">135</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Use of the whip in British horseracing</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Stewart Malcolm McDonald</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kirsten Oswald</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mr Barry Sheerman</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights that it is Children's Mental Health Week as set up by children's mental health charity Place2Be; notes the purpose of this week is to shine a spotlight on the importance of children and young people's mental health; understands that this year's theme is Find your Brave; and encourages schools, churches and voluntary sector youth organisations to use this opportunity to talk with children and build relationships discussing the theme and that life is all about taking small brave steps every day, and to outline that bravery could be about sharing worries and asking for help when it is needed, or trying something new and making the right choices.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Ben Lake</span></p>
			<p>That this House believes that the Government has for over two decades failed women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of the changes that were made to their state pension age due to equalisation brought on by the Pensions Act 1995; regrets that the Government only began writing to women affected from 2009 onward; acknowledges that the Scottish National Party previously submitted a fully funded proposal to help women born in the 1950s that was rejected by the Government; believes the onus is now on the Government to remedy the injustices suffered by millions of women across the UK; and calls on the Government to oversee a full impact assessment, which takes into account the wide reaching effects of its policy, and to make a decision on the recompense that affected women will receive based on the findings of such an assessment.</p>

			<p>That this House is very concerned by the crackdown on peaceful protest and the media in The Gambia, following the use of excessive force by security forces last month to disperse protesters calling for President Adama Barrow to fulfil his pledge to step down after three years in power, resulting in many injuries and three deaths, as well as the closure of two FM radio stations and charges of incitement brought against at least two journalists; notes that despite some progress since the departure of former President Yahya Jammeh, allegedly responsible for forced disappearances, rape and murder during two decades of authoritarian rule, serious human rights violations still need to be addressed and accountability mechanisms strengthened; urges the Gambian Government to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens, including by unconditionally releasing all those detained for exercising their right to peaceful protest, reopening radio stations it closed and releasing detained journalists; and calls on the Government, with the international community, to support the Gambian Government and civil society in the transition from dictatorship to democracy, as well as to engage with them under the auspices of the UK&#8217;s current Global Media Freedom campaign.</p>

			<p>This House deplores the Government's ongoing use of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries against the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review; notes that while the publication of the Review has been much delayed without explanation, it is expected to recommend the cessation of all deportations of people who have lived in the UK since childhood; notes that the Government has sought to justify recent deportations on the basis of the serious nature of the offences perpetrated by deportees, where this is not borne out in many cases; believes that where deportations are enforced on Foreign National Offenders who have served their sentences, this amounts to double punishment on arbitrary grounds; further believes that long-term residents should be rehabilitated in an equal fashion to their British-passport-holding peers; fears that the characterisation of all deportees as serious criminals exacerbates anti-migrant sentiment, increases racial tensions and exposes those deported to greater risk upon return; remains concerned that the Government's approach demonstrates a failure to appreciate the significant damage to trust in immigration enforcement that the Windrush Scandal represented; and calls on the Government to immediately suspend all deportations of residents who have been in the UK since childhood, and to publish and implement in full recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned that care leavers risk facing eviction and homelessness on their 22nd birthday, due to the increasing gap between the local housing allowance and private sector rents; regrets that care leavers aged 22 have their local housing allowance reduced to the lowest shared accommodation rate (SAR); notes Centrepoint&#8217;s analysis of rental data which shows that a room in a shared house would only be affordable in one of 234 local authority areas for those in receipt of the SAR; is also deeply concerned that homeless young people under the age of 25 are trapped in supported accommodation because the SAR is not enough to cover the cost of rent; regrets that this causes bed-blocking of vital spaces for other homeless people; notes that to extend the exemption from the SAR on an annual basis, it would cost around &#163;6 million for care leavers and &#163;3.8 million for homeless under 25s; and therefore urges the Chancellor to provide this relatively small amount of funding in the upcoming Budget which will make a huge difference to the lives of vulnerable young people, many of whom have experienced unspeakable trauma and difficulty.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises precision Radiotherapy as a cost effective, life-saving cancer treatment; notes that 1 in 4 people will require access to radiotherapy and that the treatment is crucial in 4 out of every 10 cancer cures; welcomes the Government's commitment to improve early cancer detection but believes the current state of radiotherapy provision is not in a position to cope with increased demand; further notes the shortfalls in radiotherapy delivery highlighted by the APPG for Radiotherapy including an estimated 24,000 patients missing out completely on radiotherapy, excessive treatment travel times, outdated equipment, staff shortages, incoherent commissioning restricting access to treatment and perverse internal tariff system which creates financial disincentives in commissioning the most modern and effective radiotherapy treatment; believes addressing these shortfalls are the route to improving the UK's cancer survival rates which lag behind international comparators; and calls on the Heath and Social Care Select Committee to hold a full inquiry into the current state of radiotherapy services as a matter of priority, add to the weight of evidence, and produce recommendations for the Government in support of increasing access and investment to this life-saving cancer treatment and press for the UK to be a world class centre of excellence for precision advanced radiotherapy.</p>

			<p>That this House is very concerned that 2.2 billion people around the world still don&#8217;t have a reliable source of clean water; believes that far too little is being done to help the most vulnerable people adapt to climate change; notes that access to a reliable source of clean water which can withstand the impacts of climate change can mean the difference between life and death, and that this makes access to basic water and sanitation services a first line of defence against climate change; recognises that failure to adapt now will cost significantly more in the long run and threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of people; and calls for the Government to recognise and prioritise water services in climate change plans at COP26.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the new draft media law in Somalia that would restrict the right to freedom of expression; notes that the Federal Parliament of Somalia sought to amend media legislation to grant the Federal Ministry of Information extensive powers to interfere in the work of journalists and independent media houses, and impact on public interest reporting in country; further notes that the law has a number of unacceptably broad restrictions on the content of what may be published or broadcast, including a prohibition on false news, encouragement of tribalism, baseless propaganda and violating sound Somali culture; believes that the draft law would also establish a costly and unnecessary new system of prosecutors to bring and hear cases regarding media crimes; is concerned that the draft law includes legal sanctions for a long new list of media crimes which are vague and breaches a journalist&#8217;s right to confidential sources; agrees with the National Union of Journalists and the National Union of Somali journalists that the draft law could enable the Somali authorities at both Federal and State level to arbitrarily prosecute journalists to undercut free expression and access to information; and calls on the Government to press President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed to think again about the draft legislation and to decline to sign the media law and to ensure that any proposed amendments are in line with Somalia&#8217;s constitutional and international obligations and commitments to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the rise in verbal and physical abuse of shopworkers, notes that according to research conducted by USDAW, over 400 retail workers were assaulted each day last year and that 62 per cent of retail staff have been the victim of either verbal or physical abuse; further notes that the view of respected criminologists is that levels of violence against shopworkers have reached epidemic proportions with lasting effects on the lives of workers, both mentally and physically; supports demands for action called for by the Freedom of Fear campaign led by USDAW, the similar demand for action call by the Co-op Group, the GMB and other Trade Unions, other leading retailers, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience  Stores; and calls on the Government to introduce measures to tackle these issues including bringing forward legislative proposals to make assaulting a public facing worker a standalone offence which would provide not only a clear deterrent to those thinking of assaulting shopworkers but also clear routes to prosecution for the police and courts dealing with this growing problem.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the significant impact of reading for pleasure in improving a child&#8217;s educational attainment and life chances; notes that children who read for pleasure daily or nearly every day are a year ahead in reading performance compared those who never do; notes with concern that child literacy rates are falling year on year; believes an improvement in literacy rates will help close the attainment gap; further notes that not all schools have libraries; recognises that 10 to 16 year olds make four time as much progress in vocabulary, maths and spelling if they read for pleasure than if their parents have a degree; further recognises that the UK has one of the lowest rankings for teenage literacy in OECD countries; highlights that reading to children, with no formal teaching agenda, is the most effective way to encourage them to read for pleasure independently; and calls on the Government to support teachers to include opportunities for non-tested story time as an intrinsic part of every school day</p>
