			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges the work of domestic abuse charity Saje Scotland to protect and support women who have been or are being domestically abused in Fife; understands that Saje Scotland aim to motivate, encourage and enable survivors of domestic abuse to live independently, without fear of abuse, harm or coercion, and to reduce victimisation and prevent re-victimisation by equipping survivors with the right knowledge and tools; further understands that Saje Scotland provide this important service through unique programmes and complementary services such as the Freedom Programme and the Toolkit for Life; notes that the support Saje Scotland provides often results in women removing themselves and their children from harmful situations, thereby reducing the impact on health and social care services; further notes that an external Social Return on Investment evaluation estimated that this work had resulted in a saving of &#163;430,148 to public services; pays credit to the Saje Scotland team for supporting over 18,000 people over the years; expresses concern that some of Saje Scotland&#8217;s funding streams have ended, putting the service at risk; and hopes that alternative funding can be sought quickly to secure the future of this vital service so it can continue to support victims of domestic abuse across Fife.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Girvan</p>
			<p>That this House remembers with great sorrow the murder of the four Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers at Ballydugan 30 years ago; conveys sincere and abiding sympathy to the families of Private John Birch, Lance Corporal John Bradley, Private Michael Adams and Private Steven Smart; and calls on the secretary of State for Northern Ireland to do all in his power to hold the remaining living perpetrators accountable and allow the families to have a form of closure in their ongoing grief.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Newlands</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the 125th anniversary of the first ever match between teams from different parts of Spain which took place on 25 April at the Velanova Velodrome between a team made up of Scottish factory workers from the Coats industrial colony at Borgony&#225;, and a team of players which would go on to help form the modern day FC Barcelona; recognises that the Scottish team was composed of players mainly from the Paisley area, with a teamsheet of Cochrane (captain), Paton, English, Munro, Lyies, Gerard, Cooper, Al. Nicol, A.Tong, H. Tong, Rushtong &amp; King (sub) and that their team, Association Torell&#243;, would go on to become the current club CD Borgony&#225;; notes that the current club continue to honour their Scots heritage with a small saltire on their black and white jerseys, the only two colours in which the factory thread was dyed, and the same kit design that Paisley team St Mirren play in; acknowledges that around 100 people attended the match, which resulted in a victory for the Barcelona select side; celebrates the Scottish influence on Catalan, Spanish, and wider global footballing history; and wishes CD Borgony&#225; the best of luck when football matches are resumed.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Newlands</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to act urgently to support the transport industry, many sectors of which have been met with silence from the Department for Transport and the Treasury; urges the Government to listen to representatives of the aviation, road haulage, coaching and holiday travel industry who have made it clear that without urgent action many companies will not survive and many thousands of their workers will be left without a job; asserts that by failing to act now, increased state intervention will be required in the long run in the form of prolonged benefit support, and in event of travel companies collapsing, a huge administrative burden with a bill to match to cover travel consumer protections; and further urges the UK Government to follow the strategy of the Scottish Government on aviation and offer all aviation related businesses 100 per cent business rates relief for a full 12 months.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House notes that 86 per cent of pigs in the UK are slaughtered with high concentrations of CO2; notes that scientific studies report that CO2 causes severe respiratory distress, pain, and hyperventilation and gasping before loss of consciousness; acknowledges that in 2003 the Government&#8217;s Farm Animal Welfare Council concluded that the use of high concentrations of CO2 to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable and urged the practice to be phased out in five years; further notes that no such phase out has been implemented; and calls on the Government to increase the research currently being undertaken into alternative methods of slaughter with a view to phasing out stunning with high concentrations of CO2 within five years.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Tim Farron</span><span class="signatory">Richard Thomson</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with disappointment the announcement on 16 April 2020 by the UK&#8217;s chief Brexit negotiator that the UK Government intends to refuse to extend the EU exit transition period beyond December 2020, risking a no-deal Brexit during a time that the UK, Europe and much of the world will be trying to recover from the public health and economic shock of Covid-19; recognises that the design and delivery of an entirely new arrangement between the UK and the EU will be extremely challenging in the midst of the current crisis; notes that coming out of the transition period without a trade deal during this time when there is already concern around supply of food, medicine and essential equipment could further disrupt vital supply chains; recognises the particular damaging impact this would have on Northern Ireland, risking disruption of all-island co-operation; and calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the EU exit transition period.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">347</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Extended cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	21/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	47</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jon Trickett</span></p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern about the extended cut-off date for employees to receive support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, after the eligibility date was extended from 28 February to 19 March; acknowledges that although this extension will allow more employees to now be furloughed following the changes to the Government scheme a large number of workers will still miss out because they are paid towards the end of each month; further notes that all workers who can be furloughed will need to have been on the payroll and the employer would need to have sent to HM Revenue &amp; Customs a real-time information submission notifying a payment in respect of those employees on or before 19 March 2020; believes that this move will not cover people who were not put on the Pay As You Earn system until after the pay cut-off date; and calls on the Government to consider further extending the cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to include this large proportion of workers who are paid monthly and the opportunity for more new employees to be furloughed.</p>

			<p>That this House commends the Chancellor&#8217;s job retention schemes to help the employed and the self-employed during the covid-19 outbreak; in addition acknowledges that thousands of people working in a creative freelance capacity are excluded from those schemes; notes that directors of small limited companies that are often comprised of one person cannot access either scheme; further notes that, because of the way the arts industry typically functions, these people usually pay themselves a low salary and rely heavily on dividends; further acknowledges that this means that receiving 80 per cent of their salary, as offered by the schemes set out by the Chancellor, is not enough to live on; and calls on the Government to close the loophole in the job retention schemes by allowing small limited company directors to claim for 80 per cent of filed average earnings, including dividends.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">352</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Rate of pay for furloughed workers</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	21/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	12</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sarah Owen</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Paul Girvan</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that, for those workers covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it is providing an essential safety net for many workers and their families during this crisis, ensuring businesses can maintain their workforce and enabling them to re-open in the future; notes that the Resolution Foundation estimates that 8 million workers could be furloughed under that scheme; further notes that that whilst Government is funding 80 per cent of the payroll for furloughed staff, employers are not obliged under terms of the scheme to top up the remaining 20 per cent to ensure no loss of pay; remains concerned about the financial impact on workers of receiving only 80 per cent of their usual take home pay, an impact which is particularly difficult for those on low pay; and therefore urges highly profitable corporations like McDonald&#8217;s, KFC, and JD Wetherspoons that have made millions  from the labour of those same workers to step up and pay the remaining 20 per cent to ensure that their workers are not forced into debt and further poverty as a result of this significant cut in pay.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">355</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Creation of a new bank holiday</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Lavery</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Neil Gray</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the contribution, work and sacrifice of all who work in the National Health Service, in other blue light services, key sectors and those selflessly volunteering during the COVID-19 crisis, many of whom are working night and day; and calls on the Government to recognise this contribution with the creation of a new Bank Holiday when the crisis is over, after a period of mourning and reflection on the lives lost during the pandemic, so that society can come together in remembrance and celebration.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Claudia Webbe</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Paul Girvan</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that migrant communities, who are disproportionately at risk of exclusion, stigma and discrimination, are not currently receiving the necessary safeguards; further notes that the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians, and Doctors of the World have called on the Government to suspend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 and 2017 and all associated immigration checks and data sharing; believes that it is vital that a clear message is sent to migrant communities that they can seek care when they need it, that they are included in society and have a part to play in response to this crisis; and therefore calls on the Government to suspend all NHS charging for migrants, suspend all data sharing between health services and the Home Office, implement a firewall to ensure that patient data will not be shared with the Home Office or other bodies for the purposes of immigration enforcement, and launch an information campaign to ensure both NHS staff and the public are aware of these changes and that it is safe for people to seek care, particularly aimed at migrant communities across the UK.</p>
