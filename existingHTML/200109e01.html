			<p>That this House celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Papur Sain Ceredigion Talking newspaper for its remarkable achievements on increasing accessibility for many people across Wales who struggle with disabilities; recognises the importance of Papur Sain Ceredigion&#8217;s initial appearance on January 1970 as the first of its kind in the UK, beginning with only an audience of 18 and today drawing in 112 listeners with varying degrees of visual impairment committed to helping them engage, be included and informed on all discussions surrounding current affairs in Wales and beyond; and commends the specific contributions of Ronald Sturt who was the lecturer at the College of Librarianship Wales in Llanbadarn Fawr and the architect of the first talking Newspaper, who sadly passed away on 6 January 2003 aged 81, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy that was marked by his creation and first presidency of the Talking Newspaper Association UK, now known as the Talking Newspaper Federation; and notes that Mr Sturt is most of all remembered for inspiring a whole new generation to carry on this significant work that started with him 50 years ago.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the benefits of prescribed medical cannabis for people suffering with chronic pain, epilepsy and a variety of other conditions; welcomes the legalisation around the use of prescribed medical cannabis on 1 November 2018; but regrets the difficulties patients and their families continue to face accessing prescribed medical cannabis that their consultants have prescribed through the NHS; further regrets the restrictive NHS guidelines that prevents most patients from accessing it and deters specialist consultants from prescribing it; condemns the two-tier system that this has created where only those who can afford to pay for the prescription have easy and ready access to prescribed medical cannabis; and calls on the Government to use every means necessary to ensure that NHS patients have easy access to prescribed medical cannabis should their specialist consultant prescribe it for them</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Benarty Kids Community Club on organising the first ever free Christmas Day community lunch at the Lochore Institute; understands that the event was organised entirely by volunteers for the whole community, particularly anyone vulnerable or facing spending the day alone, as well as those who simply wished to celebrate Christmas surrounded by friendly faces; notes that around 40 people enjoyed a delicious three-course meal in return for a modest donation to the local foodbank; believes that the strength of community spirit shown by the organisers and volunteers who helped out on the day is testament to the kind-hearted and compassionate nature of the people of Benarty; and pays credit to Benarty Kids Community Club for the difference it makes to the lives of so many Benarty families, not just on Christmas Day, but all year round.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Munira Wilson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Edward Davey</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sarah Olney</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the appalling service that passengers of South Western Railway (SWR) have experienced since the former Secretary of State for Transport, the Rt Hon Member for Epsom and Ewell, awarded the franchise to SWR in March 2017; further recognises that commuters' journeys were severely disrupted by the recent 27 day strike due to the continuing dispute between SWR and the RMT union; notes that recent accounts published by Companies House show SWR lost &#163;137 million in the year to March 2019 and that the Directors' Statement published alongside those accounts made clear that there is material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern; calls on the Secretary of State for Transport to make a statement to Parliament setting out what actions he is taking to improve the train services for people living in the South Western franchise area, to penalise SWR for their lamentable performance, and any related poor performance by Network Rail, and to ensure this franchise is operated by a financially sound and competent company; and believes the best short and medium term option would be for the South Western rail franchise to be transferred to Transport for London.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	9/01/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tracey Crouch</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government's public consultation on controls on the import and export of hunting trophies; notes the strong cross-party support for EDM 1829, Session 2017-19 and that 86 per cent of the British public support an end to trophy hunting; further notes that most UK trophy imports are of threatened species and that the number of trophy imports from captive-bred animals is growing; believes that trophy hunting has had devastating impacts on some wildlife populations and that the pursuit of animals with the largest tusks, horns, or antlers is resulting in artificial selection which imperils the survival of these species; further believes that trophy hunting fees rarely provide substantive funding for conservation or benefits to local communities; is strongly of the view that killing animals for trophies is indefensible and cruel and that it has no place in the modern world; urges policy-makers to work with stakeholders to support sustainable economic development that creates real prosperity for people through preserving our natural heritage; and calls on the Government to implement a comprehensive ban on trophy hunting imports and exports as quickly as possible, to consider an immediate moratorium, and to work with other Governments to help bring an end to trophy hunting.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wes Streeting</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir Edward Davey</span><span class="signatory">Daniel Zeichner</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes this Government could be responsible for five of the remaining 11 years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned are left to halve global emissions and limit warming to 1.5C; further notes that the Committee on Climate Change report in July 2019 revealed the Government had delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to get on track to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets than net zero by 2050, and that the UK's climate credibility rested on decisive Government action over thesubsequent 18 months; considers therefore that this Parliament will be regarded as the Climate Parliament and must seize this opportunity to ensure adequate action is taken to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown; welcomes the fact that the UK will host the UN climate summit COP26 in December 2020; considers success at this summit means recognising the moral imperative of doing everything possible to keep temperature rise to 1.5C, and the vast human cost to people around the world, including the UK, from extreme weather, food insecurity, sea level rise, and other events exacerbated by the climate crisis; urges the Government therefore to make addressing the climate emergency the central priority for domestic policy-making across all departments and on the global stage; and calls on the Government to enact a comprehensive Green New Deal, including the release of necessary funding to allow local authorities to lead, to rapidly decarbonise the entire UK economy while creating a fair and just society.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that veterans are an asset to our society and deserve the best possible care and support; considers that those who have been injured in the service of the UK deserve the full value of their War Disablement Pension; notes that under the current system the War Disablement Pension is counted as income by the Department of Work and Pensions and can therefore lead to veterans being materially disadvantaged when claiming Employment Support Allowance; welcomes the Scottish Government's alteration of the rules to ensure that the War Disablement Pension is exempt from income assessments and that veterans therefore receive its full value; and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to follow suit and disregard the War Disablement Pension from means-testing.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Wendy Chamberlain</span><span class="signatory">Sir Edward Davey</span><span class="signatory">Mr Virendra Sharma</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the previous Government&#8217;s plans to extend the off-payroll (IR35) changes to the private sector, despite the damage that this has done to the public sector including the NHS; further notes that the off-payroll tax means a 14.3 per cent extra cost on UK business made up of National Insurance and the Apprenticeship Levy; believes that this will damage the UK&#8217;s flexible workforce and the UK economy, driving up project costs and depriving businesses of access to key skills; notes that firms are already laying off self-employed contractors and that others are looking to offshore resource to avoid the extra costs; further notes that HMRC estimate that 153,000 UK contractors could lose up 25 per cent of their pay and that thousands of contractors will be asked to pay their clients employment tax bills, without getting the benefits of employment such as sick and holiday pay and a pension contribution; is concerned that the off-payroll tax will lead to tax non-compliance and the danger of people being lured into avoidance schemes, as happened with those now facing the loan charge; welcomes the commitment made by the Chancellor to hold an IR35 review made during the election, but believes this is will only be a genuine review if the roll-out is halted; and therefore calls for an immediate halt to the off-payroll tax roll-out and announcement of an independent review looking into how best to recognise contracting and freelancing in the tax system..</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Fife Council's Caf&#233; Inc initiative on delivering thousands of meals to hungry families across the region during the festive period; notes that the scheme aims to alleviate holiday hunger by providing access to hot meals and packed lunches to under-privileged families; further notes that the initiative has the added benefit of tackling social isolation by offering a place for people to meet and interact, strengthening community cohesion; understands that the initiative was first trialled as a lunch club during the Easter holidays in the Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly areas and that, due to its success, it was rolled out across 21 venues during Christmas 2019; acknowledges that it is a blight on society that in a country as economically wealthy as Scotland, this type of support is required; urges the Government to do more to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and reduce the need for this type of intervention and pays credit to all of the staff and volunteers who have contributed to making Caf&#233; Inc such a success.</p>
