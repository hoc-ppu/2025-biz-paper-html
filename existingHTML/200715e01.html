			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	15/07/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House believes that free bets offered by gambling companies are designed to lock and trap people into gambling as a result of the requirement to provide deposit cash, bank and credit card details and personal details to gain access to those bets; notes that the advertising of free bets encourages people who are addicted to gambling or who cannot afford to gamble; and calls on the Government to implement a ban on the advertising of free bets, and the repetitive pop-up targeting of free bet advertisements online as a matter of urgency.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House notes that gambling in all its forms can destroy the lives of the people addicted to it and have a huge effect on their family and people close to them; further notes that credit encourages people to gamble with money that they do not have; and calls on the Government to implement a total ban on the use of credit cards for all forms of gambling and online gambling in particular.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">730</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Catch up funding for 16-19 year old pupils</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Layla Moran</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Munira Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House deplores the decision to exclude providers of 16-19 education from the Government&#8217;s catch-up funding for students after the covid-19 outbreak, notes that 16-19 year olds have missed out on months of their education at a crucial juncture where they would have been sitting exams and preparing to move into higher education, other training or entering the job market; further notes that for those nearing the end of their school career there is very limited time to catch up on the studies they have missed and as such those young people could find their future education, training and job opportunities permanently affected; and calls on the Government to urgently commit to providing catch-up funding for 16-19 education settings at the same level as is being provided for pupils in primary and secondary schools.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Barry Sheerman</p>
			<p>That this House notes the contribution brought about by vehicle safety standards, consumer safety ratings and manufacturing initiatives to reducing death and serious injury in collisions on the UK's roads over the last 25 years; recognises with concern the scope for potential lowering of vehicle safety standards in negotiations on free trade agreements, particularly with the USA which has lower legislative standards of front and side impact protection and does not require safer car fronts for pedestrian and cyclists in car design; and calls on the Government to ensure that no vehicle is imported to the UK with lower than UK/EU vehicle safety standards.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">734</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>75th anniversary of the first nuclear test explosion</h3>

			<p>That this House notes that the mental health consequences of the covid-19 pandemic are immense and will be long-lasting; asserts that existing demand for mental health services is set to increase and agrees with The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association that mental health services, already buckling under the level of demand pre-covid-19 pandemic are now facing a potential tsunami of escalation without the resources to cope; further notes that research including the University of Oxford Co-SPACE survey have observed an increase in children&#8217;s mental health problems particularly in the years 4 to 10 age range; agrees with Professor Cathy Cresswell, Professor of Developmental Clinical Psychology at the University of Oxford that prioritising the mental health of children throughout the covid-19 pandemic and beyond is critical; notes that the announcement in the Queen&#8217;s Speech of December 2019 that the Mental Health Act 1989 will be reformed gave no specific mention of the urgent needs of children; and calls on the Government to commit to an early reform of the Mental Health Act 1989 during this Parliament and to guarantee that policies to prioritise the urgent mental health needs of children will be at the heart of the drafting of that new Bill and on the face of that Bill.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the vast cuts to news media jobs in Wales; further notes that more than seventy journalists working at Media Wales, which publishes the Western Mail, South Wales Echo and South Wales Evening Post,  have been notified that their jobs are currently on a redundancy at risk list; is distressed that staff at the Daily Post newspaper in North Wales are also at risk of significant job losses; is alarmed that Newsquest is losing twenty five dedicated staff while BBC Cymru Wales is expecting to make sixty people redundant; further notes with concern the devastating impact those decisions will have in muting the voice of the Welsh press and media in a critical time where the people of Wales require direct, relevant and clear information on contentious political issues the most; acknowledges the importance of the Welsh media in reflecting the values and the diversity of life in Wales; and asserts that that can only be achieved through committing to a sustained, adequately sized media workforce.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the acts of aggression by Armenia overnight on 12 July 2020 which further escalates the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan which is rooted in Armenia's military control over Azerbaijan's Nagorno Karabakh region and adjacent seven districts that in the early 1990s led to the death of 30,000 people and the fleeing of more than 1 million internally displaced persons from their homes; calls on the UK Government to condemn the recent actions of Armenia which represent a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process and which have violated international law as well as the ceasefire agreement signed in 1994; further notes that the military flare up along the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the involvement of heavy artillery is a flagrant violation of international law as well as the ceasefire agreed in 1994 and represents a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process; urges the UK Government to support the call for the OSCE Minsk Group to investigate thoroughly to prevent the current military action escalating into an all-out war; and further calls on the UK Government to urge for the withdrawal of Armenian military forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan as stated in UN Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the World Intellectual Property Organisation&#8217;s Beijing Treaty on Audio-Visual Performances which came into force on 28 April 2020; notes that the aim of that Treaty is to extend the economic and moral rights of actors and performers in audio-visual performances including films, videos and television programs; is concerned that not all signatories who have ratified that Treaty have done so in ways that are consistent with that aim; recognises the importance of the audio-visual industry to the UK economy and the integral role played by audio-visual performers who enrich our daily lives with their craft; considers that ratifying the Treaty in such a way as to allow for the economic and moral rights of actors and performers to be immediately transferred to the producer undermines a performer&#8217;s remuneration right; understands the importance of the concept of national treatment to secure revenues from usage of work in other countries; calls on the Government to enable an early ratification of the Beijing Treaty in line with that Treaty&#8217;s clearly stated aims; and further calls on the Government to undertake early talks with secondary users to ensure a fair and affordable system for upholding performers&#8217; rights.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the wonderful work done by communities throughout Northern Ireland in celebrating the Glorious 12th in a massively pared back and restricted manner; highlights that the celebrations which annually sees hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of spectators were sacrificed due to safety concerns and thanks all of those who celebrated at home and in small safe gatherings; further notes local bands who made the effort to play in their local developments giving neighbours the opportunity to enjoy the music whilst safe in their gardens; and looks toward to next year when communities can celebrate with each other once again in peace and safety in the name of religious freedom and liberty for all.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the current provisions provided by the Home Office to support those seeking asylum throughout the pandemic; asks the Government to review the current claiming system and modify it to allow for an asylum claim to be made remotely; demands that the financial support provided by the Government is increased by at least &#163;20 per week to reflect the emergency changes made to the standard rate of universal credit and the increasing prices for essential goods; calls on the Government to review the current accommodation provided to asylum seekers to ensure that all accommodation allows for social distancing and self-isolation to align with the guidance given by the Department for Health and Social Care; and further calls on the Government to provide sufficient cleaning and personal hygiene supplies to prevent the spread of the virus in any shared accommodation.</p>

			<p>That this House is appalled by the behaviour of the tiny British Association of Journalists (BAJ), which is not affiliated to the TUC and has no international trade union connection, in reaching a wholly unethical and unprincipled sweetheart deal with the management of Iran International; believes that this move was a deliberate attempt to undermine the rights of minority ethnic workers seeking formal recognition of the National Union of Journalists, whose case is active with ACAS; notes that previously there were no known BAJ members or presence at the company, but understands there is now a single BAJ representative, a senior manager appointed by the union and management, and staff are now being put under pressure to join the union; and supports NUJ members at Iran International, NUJ chapels and branches nationwide, the TUC and wider trade union movement and in offering solidarity in their efforts to secure democratic and independent trade union representation.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that at this time when all parts of the United Kingdom have come together to fight COVID 19 and to support front line key workers when our country needs the NHS more than ever to be free at the point of delivery, Members of both Houses need to come together to support an end to car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England; recognises that the NHS was established to be free at the point of access; contends that extortionate car parking charges mean that the NHS is not free at the point of access for people with cars; further recognises that the charges are not only unfair for patients and their visitors but for hardworking NHS staff; realises that this is a clear injustice; and therefore urges the Government to scrap car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England and calls on all the devolved Administrations to do the same.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to discontinue the ability of elected MPs to participate remotely in parliamentary debates, bill committees and by electronic voting is unlawful and discriminatory because it means that up to 250 elected MPs, who are clinically shielded to protect themselves or their families from coronavirus, are no longer able to participate in these activities; further believes that the House of Commons is not empowered to remove the source of its own legitimacy and that the vote to do so was illegal as it excluded the elected MPs affected; calls for the restoration of the democratic rights of all elected MPs who are shielding, and of the constituencies and 15.5 million voters that they represent, to fully participate and for the resumption of virtual arrangements previously in place that continue in the House of Lords, the Senedd and Holyrood; and calls on the Leader of the House of Commons to reinstate the motion allowing online inclusion for shielded elected MPs in all debates and votes, including those on the legal and democratic rights of those elected MPs most affected by the removal of hybrid arrangements; further calls for the resumption of elected MPs&#8217; equal right to work in all aspects of their job, without unreasonable risk to their personal safety, by using the technology available and for the full restoration, without delay, of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament.</p>
