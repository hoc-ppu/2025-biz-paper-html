			<p class="MotionSponsor">Robert Halfon</p>
			<p>That this House notes the serious allegations made by waste operatives employed by Veolia in Harlow of workplace bullying by management staff; expresses concern at the significant accusations of harassment, lack of training, poor management and all-round misery in the workplace; further notes one particular account of chairs being removed from the common spaces in the Veolia workplace in Harlow, forcing employees to sit on the floor during meetings; acknowledges that these allegations suggest serious ill-treatment of employees and a poor working environment; further recognises the potential impact this has on employees&#8217; mental health; raises further concern that Harlow Council has allegedly been aware of the ongoing issues at Veolia in Harlow, yet has been slow to intervene; and therefore calls for an urgent inquiry into the potential malpractice of Veolia in Harlow and for formal grievance procedures to be commenced.</p>

			<p>That this House applauds the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) for upholding its integrity in a delicate geopolitical position through adroit management of regional and international relations; supports its efforts to improve relations with the federal government in Baghdad through fully implementing the federal constitution; believes that Kurdistan&#8217;s quest for good relations with its neighbours while freely choosing allies facilitates vital investment, trade, and capacity-building expertise; recognises that this bolsters reforms to diversify their economy, improve public services, and boost a vibrant private sector and civil society; further believes that such reforms encourage greater accountability, transparency, and participation by youth and women; proudly notes that the KRG identifies the UK as a partner of choice and commends the UK/KRG Reform Partnership to, for instance, professionalise and unify the Peshmerga; commends the Peshmerga and the KRG for successfully maintaining internal security and stability and exemplary religious moderation, tolerance and pluralism that defies extremism, which remains potent despite major territorial losses by the so-called Islamic State; agrees with the KRG that withdrawing UK, US and other troops from Iraq would be unwise and that Iraq should not be a battlefield for others; suggests that the KRG&#8217;s position and experience enables it to better interact with relevant actors to de-escalate tensions and makes the KRG a vital interlocutor for UK foreign and security policy; and urges the UK Government at the earliest opportunity to invite the KRG leadership on an official visit to meet the Prime Minister and others and consolidate these bilateral relations.</p>

			<p>That this House is aware that the hormone pregnancy drug test, Primodos, was taken by approximately 1.5 million women in the 1960s and 1970s to test for pregnancy; understands that there is considerable evidence that many women who took this drug either gave birth to babies with serious deformities, miscarried, or had stillbirths, with the babies affected now in their 40s and 50s, having experienced a lifetime with serious disabilities; seeks answers as to why no official warnings were issued about this drug until eight years after the first major report that indicated possible dangers; is alarmed that some doctors were still prescribing this drug for pregnant women after official warnings were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines; has deep concerns about the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-led expert working group's review of this issue which seems to have been shrouded in secrecy; urges the UK Government to fully respond to concerns raised about the methodology of this review, the independence of the panel members, the conclusions of the report and the fact that key information seems to have been withheld from the report in order to suggest that there is no link between Primodos and birth defects; welcomes the announcement by the former Prime Minister in February 2018 of a review of this scandal involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos; and urges the current Prime Minister to ensure that a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter is established without delay, to ensure justice for those affected.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the death sentence imposed on Mr Junaid Hafeez, a lecturer at Bahauddin Zakariya University, Pakistan; notes that his first defence lawyer was assassinated by extremists, his second lawyer was intimidated into dropping his case, and the third lawyer has received many such threats; further notes that the trial proceedings are unsafe, unsatisfactory and contrary to Pakistan's constitutional guarantees of due process and fair trial; expresses alarm that Mr Hafeez has been in solitary confinement for six years after he was attacked by other prisoners in the jail; recognises that this lengthy confinement is contrary to the provisions of Article 7 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights to which Pakistan is a signatory; and appeals to the Supreme Court of Pakistan to expedite the case by taking Suo Moto action and to review the case on an urgent basis.</p>

			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around &#163;10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to &#163;10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid &#163;728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of &#163;9.30 per hour (&#163;10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply saddened at the passing of Glasgow-born artist, author and creative genius, Alasdair Gray, who died on 29 December 2019 aged 85, and sends its condolences and best wishes to all knew him; notes that Alasdair studied at the Glasgow School of Art, and became famous for his murals across the city, including Arcadia Theme, the stairwell mural in the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant on Ashton Lane, the ceiling of the Oran Mor auditorium, considered to be the largest public work of art in Scotland, and his most recent, the 40 foot mural for the entrance hall of Hillhead subway station in the West End of Glasgow, which includes local landmarks and, in Alasdair's own words, a section devoted to "all kinds of folk" and "folk of all kinds"; further notes that his body of work included the novels Lanark, and 1982, Janine, plays including The Fall of Kelvin Walker, and many works of poetry, short stories and polemic including Why Scots Should Rule Scotland, first published in 1992; believes that Alasdair's works have influenced, engaged, inspired and entertained many generations of artists and society at large, and that these works will continue to do so, representing a fitting legacy for a cultural giant.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to use all diplomatic and economic measures at its disposal to influence the Indian and Pakistan Governments to ensure that democracy is respected and that the Kashmiri people are at the heart of any constitutional reform of the region, including respecting both the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, particularly UNSCR 47 which refers to the people of Jammu and Kashmir having the right to self-determination and the 1972 Simla Agreement which refers to the future of Jammu and Kashmir being determined by peaceful means; and urges the Government to use all international fora to press for the rule of law in Kashmir to be upheld and human rights protected by lifting the telecommunications black out and allowing independent, international observers to the region as well as supporting the assistance of a UN Special Envoy for Kashmir in facilitating a peaceful and sustainable future for Kashmir.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that UK homes are amongst the least energy efficient in Europe, with low energy efficiency and high energy costs being particularly problematic in rural areas; acknowledges that living in fuel poverty causes significant hardship and suffering; accepts the link between fuel poverty and increased winter mortality; recognises the determined efforts by the Scottish Government to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty in Scotland through the Warmer Homes Scotland initiative and the availability of Home Energy Scotland loans; welcomes Government initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty through schemes such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) but is concerned that the lack of funding and how it is funded needs more consideration; appreciates that more work is needed to help householders pay their bills, increase energy security, stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change; remains concerned about the failings in oversight associated with the Government&#8217;s Green Deal which resulted in thousands of householders being mis-sold government-backed energy efficiency measures, with consumer concerns persisting about Home Energy and Lifestyle Management Systems (HELMS); appreciates that such cases erode consumer confidence in government-backed energy efficiency schemes; notes with concern complaints about sales techniques and poor workmanship of companies engaged under the ECO; and calls on the Government to review and monitor the oversight of such schemes to ensure they are as robust as they can be, with sufficient protections in place for householders in which they can have full confidence.</p>

			<p>That this House celebrates that over 17,000 students at UK universities studied or worked abroad through the Erasmus+ programme in 2017-18, as well as thousands of school pupils, college students, apprentices, adult learners and teachers who took part in projects to study, work or train abroad, build international partnerships and share best practice; recognises that Erasmus+ has made studying abroad attractive and affordable by providing financial assistance to students who take part; highlights that the benefits of studying or working abroad include increased employability and the opportunities to learn a new language, fall in love with another country&#8217;s culture, build new friendships and act as ambassadors for the UK overseas; notes that the EU intends to expand Erasmus+ from 2021, with MEPs voting in March 2019 both to triple its budget for 2021-27 compared to 2014-20, and to place greater emphasis on widening access to study abroad opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; recalls the conclusions of the House of Lords European Union Committee&#8217;s 28th Report of Session 2017-19 that a replacement UK-led student mobility scheme would find it impossible to replicate aspects of Erasmus which are key to facilitating international exchanges, namely, the programme&#8217;s strong brand, trusted reputation, common rulebook and framework for partnership agreements, and its established network of potential partners; and accordingly calls on the Government to follow the Committee&#8217;s recommendation to seek full association to the 2021-27 Erasmus programme.</p>
