			<p>That this House is deeply saddened at the passing of Glasgow-born artist, author and creative genius, Alasdair Gray, who died on 29 December 2019 aged 85, and sends its condolences and best wishes to all knew him; notes that Alasdair studied at the Glasgow School of Art, and became famous for his murals across the city, including Arcadia Theme, the stairwell mural in the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant on Ashton Lane, the ceiling of the Oran Mor auditorium, considered to be the largest public work of art in Scotland, and his most recent, the 40 foot mural for the entrance hall of Hillhead subway station in the West End of Glasgow, which includes local landmarks and, in Alasdair's own words, a section devoted to "all kinds of folk" and "folk of all kinds"; further notes that his body of work included the novels Lanark, and 1982, Janine, plays including The Fall of Kelvin Walker, and many works of poetry, short stories and polemic including Why Scots Should Rule Scotland, first published in 1992; believes that Alasdair's works have influenced, engaged, inspired and entertained many generations of artists and society at large, and that these works will continue to do so, representing a fitting legacy for a cultural giant.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Desmond Swayne</p>
			<p>That this House commends the establishment and operation by key utility companies, such as Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, of priority services registers; notes that these registers encourage consumers with children under five, or with hearing, sight or other disabilities, or who are chronically ill, or rely on electricity for medical equipment, or are over 60, to register with the company for priority treatment, advice and support in the event of power loss; welcomes the fact that the priority services registration scheme is free of charge; and accordingly encourages all who fall into the various categories of vulnerability qualifying for the scheme to register and take advantage of this commendable service.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tahir Ali</p>
			<p>That this House calls on the Government to use all diplomatic and economic measures at its disposal to influence the Indian and Pakistan Governments to ensure that democracy is respected and that the Kashmiri people are at the heart of any constitutional reform of the region, including respecting both the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, particularly UNSCR 47 which refers to the people of Jammu and Kashmir having the right to self-determination and the 1972 Simla Agreement which refers to the future of Jammu and Kashmir being determined by peaceful means; and urges the Government to use all international fora to press for the rule of law in Kashmir to be upheld and human rights protected by lifting the telecommunications black out and allowing independent, international observers to the region as well as supporting the assistance of a UN Special Envoy for Kashmir in facilitating a peaceful and sustainable future for Kashmir.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p>That this House notes that UK homes are amongst the least energy efficient in Europe, with low energy efficiency and high energy costs being particularly problematic in rural areas; acknowledges that living in fuel poverty causes significant hardship and suffering; accepts the link between fuel poverty and increased winter mortality; recognises the determined efforts by the Scottish Government to improve energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty in Scotland through the Warmer Homes Scotland initiative and the availability of Home Energy Scotland loans; welcomes Government initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty through schemes such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) but is concerned that the lack of funding and how it is funded needs more consideration; appreciates that more work is needed to help householders pay their bills, increase energy security, stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change; remains concerned about the failings in oversight associated with the Government&#8217;s Green Deal which resulted in thousands of householders being mis-sold government-backed energy efficiency measures, with consumer concerns persisting about Home Energy and Lifestyle Management Systems (HELMS); appreciates that such cases erode consumer confidence in government-backed energy efficiency schemes; notes with concern complaints about sales techniques and poor workmanship of companies engaged under the ECO; and calls on the Government to review and monitor the oversight of such schemes to ensure they are as robust as they can be, with sufficient protections in place for householders in which they can have full confidence.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Daisy Cooper</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Alistair Carmichael</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House celebrates that over 17,000 students at UK universities studied or worked abroad through the Erasmus+ programme in 2017-18, as well as thousands of school pupils, college students, apprentices, adult learners and teachers who took part in projects to study, work or train abroad, build international partnerships and share best practice; recognises that Erasmus+ has made studying abroad attractive and affordable by providing financial assistance to students who take part; highlights that the benefits of studying or working abroad include increased employability and the opportunities to learn a new language, fall in love with another country&#8217;s culture, build new friendships and act as ambassadors for the UK overseas; notes that the EU intends to expand Erasmus+ from 2021, with MEPs voting in March 2019 both to triple its budget for 2021-27 compared to 2014-20, and to place greater emphasis on widening access to study abroad opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; recalls the conclusions of the House of Lords European Union Committee&#8217;s 28th Report of Session 2017-19 that a replacement UK-led student mobility scheme would find it impossible to replicate aspects of Erasmus which are key to facilitating international exchanges, namely, the programme&#8217;s strong brand, trusted reputation, common rulebook and framework for partnership agreements, and its established network of potential partners; and accordingly calls on the Government to follow the Committee&#8217;s recommendation to seek full association to the 2021-27 Erasmus programme.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Olivia Blake</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government's public consultation on controls on the import and export of hunting trophies; notes the strong cross-party support for EDM 1829, Session 2017-19 and that 86 per cent of the British public support an end to trophy hunting; further notes that most UK trophy imports are of threatened species and that the number of trophy imports from captive-bred animals is growing; believes that trophy hunting has had devastating impacts on some wildlife populations and that the pursuit of animals with the largest tusks, horns, or antlers is resulting in artificial selection which imperils the survival of these species; further believes that trophy hunting fees rarely provide substantive funding for conservation or benefits to local communities; is strongly of the view that killing animals for trophies is indefensible and cruel and that it has no place in the modern world; urges policy-makers to work with stakeholders to support sustainable economic development that creates real prosperity for people through preserving our natural heritage; and calls on the Government to implement a comprehensive ban on trophy hunting imports and exports as quickly as possible, to consider an immediate moratorium, and to work with other Governments to help bring an end to trophy hunting.</p>

			<p>That this House is aware that the hormone pregnancy drug test, Primodos, was taken by approximately 1.5 million women in the 1960s and 1970s to test for pregnancy; understands that there is considerable evidence that many women who took this drug either gave birth to babies with serious deformities, miscarried, or had stillbirths, with the babies affected now in their 40s and 50s, having experienced a lifetime with serious disabilities; seeks answers as to why no official warnings were issued about this drug until eight years after the first major report that indicated possible dangers; is alarmed that some doctors were still prescribing this drug for pregnant women after official warnings were issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines; has deep concerns about the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency-led expert working group's review of this issue which seems to have been shrouded in secrecy; urges the UK Government to fully respond to concerns raised about the methodology of this review, the independence of the panel members, the conclusions of the report and the fact that key information seems to have been withheld from the report in order to suggest that there is no link between Primodos and birth defects; welcomes the announcement by the former Prime Minister in February 2018 of a review of this scandal involving the pregnancy test drug Primodos; and urges the current Prime Minister to ensure that a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter is established without delay, to ensure justice for those affected.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the 77 per cent increase in the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation in England to 84,740 since 2010, including 126,020 children, with a further 82,000 children sofa surfing according to the Children&#8217;s Commissioner; is concerned that according to Crisis a further 3.74 million people would rather have a home of their own; condemns the increasing number of homeless individuals dying, including 726 in 2018 alone; recognises that a large proportion of homelessness is the result of cuts to housing benefit; notes that the increase in evictions is driven by insecure tenancies and exacerbated by court action, that temporary accommodation for some is lasting over ten years, and that the impact on the health and well-being of homeless people and their children can be very severe; and calls on the Government to support the Elimination of Homelessness Bill, urgently take steps to increase housing and council tax benefit as well as universal credit, and adequately fund local authorities to ensure that no property remains empty or unused for more than six months.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the growing body of evidence, including research reports by Doctors of the World, Maternity Action and the British Medical Association, that the NHS England overseas visitors charging regime is deterring vulnerable migrant women living in the UK from seeking essential maternity care; is further concerned that the MBRRACE-UK report, Saving Lives, Improving Mothers&#8217; Care 2019, published on 13 December 2019, links the charging regime and a possible fear of being charged to the deaths of three women who delayed seeking critical antenatal care in 2015-17; notes that the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Midwives have all urged ministers to suspend the charging regime pending a full independent review of its impact on individual and public health; further notes that less than 40 per cent of the total sum of charges levied in England in recent years has actually been recovered by the NHS; agrees with the stated view of the Royal College of Midwives that the Government has a duty to give the NHS the resources it needs and should not be using NHS clinicians to patrol our borders; and urges the Government to respond positively to Maternity Action&#8217;s call, supported by the Royal College of Midwives, for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care.</p>

			<p>That this House regrets that the UK Government's proposed statutory minimum wage would be lower than the real Living Wage, and would therefore not meet the minimum income needed for an acceptable living standard; condemns the differing rates of the statutory minimum wage for young people, which is wholly unjust and discriminatory, as it does not take account of their needs, responsibilities and living costs; believes that the so-called National Living Wage is more aptly described as the statutory minimum wage; is aware that the Chancellor has pledged that the statutory minimum wage will increase, reaching two-thirds of median earnings within five years (projected to be around &#163;10.50 an hour in 2024), provided economic conditions allow; notes independent analysis by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, which found that, on current trends, the real Living Wage would rise to &#163;10.90 by 2024 and a minimum wage worker on 35 hours a week would be paid &#163;728 less than the real Living Wage under the UK Government's proposals; is concerned that the UK Government has suspended the scheme for naming and shaming employers found to be in breach of the statutory minimum wage; welcomes the new real Living Wage rate of &#163;9.30 per hour (&#163;10.75 per hour in London); and calls on the UK Government to either increase the statutory minimum wage to at least the level of the real Living Wage and end age discrimination or to devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament to do so.</p>
