			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Beijing Treaty on Audio-Visual Performances which came into force on 28 April 2020; notes that the aim of the Treaty is to to extend the economic and moral rights of actors and performers in audio-visual performances including films, videos and television programs; is concerned that not all signatories who have ratified the Treaty have done so in ways that are consistent with this aim; recognises the importance of the audio-visual industry to the UK economy and the integral role played by audio-visual performers who enrich our daily lives with their craft; considers that ratifying the Treaty in such a way as to allow for the economic and moral rights of actors and performers to be immediately transferred to the producer undermines a performer’s remuneration right; understands the importance of the concept of national treatment to secure revenues from usage of work in other countries; and therefore calls on the Government to enable an early ratification of the Beijing Treaty in line with the Treaty’s clearly stated aims, and further calls on the Government to undertake early talks with secondary users to ensure a fair and affordable system for upholding performers’ rights.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the wonderful work done by communities throughout Northern Ireland in celebrating the Glorious 12th in a massively pared back and restricted manner; highlights that the celebrations which annually sees hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of spectators were sacrificed due to safety concerns and thanks all of those who celebrated at home and in small safe gatherings; further notes local bands who made the effort to play in their local developments giving neighbours the opportunity to enjoy the music whilst safe in their gardens; and looks toward to next year when communities can celebrate with each other once again in peace and safety in the name of religious freedom and liberty for all.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned about the current provisions provided by the Home Office to support those seeking asylum throughout the pandemic; asks the Government to review the current claiming system and modify it to allow for an asylum claim to be made remotely; demands that the financial support provided by the Government is increased by at least £20 per week to reflect the emergency changes made to the standard rate of universal credit and the increasing prices for essential goods; calls on the Government to review the current accommodation provided to asylum seekers to ensure that all accommodation allows for social distancing and self-isolation to align with the guidance given by the Department for Health and Social Care; and further calls on the Government to provide sufficient cleaning and personal hygiene supplies to prevent the spread of the virus in any shared accommodation.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p>That this House is appalled by the behaviour of the tiny British Association of Journalists (BAJ), which is not affiliated to the TUC and has no international trade union connection, in reaching a wholly unethical and unprincipled sweetheart deal with the management of Iran International; believes that this move was a deliberate attempt to undermine the rights of minority ethnic workers seeking formal recognition of the National Union of Journalists, whose case is active with ACAS; notes that previously there were no known BAJ members or presence at the company, but understands there is now a single BAJ representative, a senior manager appointed by the union and management, and staff are now being put under pressure to join the union; and supports NUJ members at Iran International, NUJ chapels and branches nationwide, the TUC and wider trade union movement and in offering solidarity in their efforts to secure democratic and independent trade union representation.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House believes that at this time when all parts of the United Kingdom have come together to fight COVID 19 and to support front line key workers when our country needs the NHS more than ever to be free at the point of delivery, Members of both Houses need to come together to support an end to car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England; recognises that the NHS was established to be free at the point of access; contends that extortionate car parking charges mean that the NHS is not free at the point of access for people with cars; further recognises that the charges are not only unfair for patients and their visitors but for hardworking NHS staff; realises that this is a clear injustice; and therefore urges the Government to scrap car parking charges at NHS hospitals in England and calls on all the devolved Administrations to do the same.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to discontinue the ability of elected MPs to participate remotely in parliamentary debates, bill committees and by electronic voting is unlawful and discriminatory because it means that up to 250 elected MPs, who are clinically shielded to protect themselves or their families from coronavirus, are no longer able to participate in these activities; further believes that the House of Commons is not empowered to remove the source of its own legitimacy and that the vote to do so was illegal as it excluded the elected MPs affected; calls for the restoration of the democratic rights of all elected MPs who are shielding, and of the constituencies and 15.5 million voters that they represent, to fully participate and for the resumption of virtual arrangements previously in place that continue in the House of Lords, the Senedd and Holyrood; and calls on the Leader of the House of Commons to reinstate the motion allowing online inclusion for shielded elected MPs in all debates and votes, including those on the legal and democratic rights of those elected MPs most affected by the removal of hybrid arrangements; further calls for the resumption of elected MPs’ equal right to work in all aspects of their job, without unreasonable risk to their personal safety, by using the technology available and for the full restoration, without delay, of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament.</p>

			<p>That this House rejects the Prime Minister’s claim on Monday 6 July 2020 that too many care homes didn&apos;t really follow the procedures during the covid-19 outbreak; further notes that during Prime Minister’s Questions on 24 June 2020, the Prime Minister stated that he accepted responsibility for everything that has happened throughout the  crisis; and calls on the Prime Minister to make a public apology for the deep offence his remarks caused to people who lost loved ones and to people who continue to fight covid-19 on the front-line in care homes.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges the publication of a report into the effect of covid-19 on call-centre workers by Philip Taylor, Professor of Work and Employment Studies, at the University of Strathclyde; recognises that the report raises concerns about unsafe working environments at many call centres including poor social distancing measures, hot-desking, poor cleansing and a lack of remote or home-working options; notes that the report records concerning levels of anxiety and fear among call-centre staff regarding their risk of catching or transferring covid-19 in their workplace; further notes that the report considers the matter to be as much a public health concern as an occupational health issue due to the risk of call centre workers spreading infection; appreciates that, while the document is focused on Scotland, the content and recommendations are equally applicable to the rest of the UK; further recognises that the report makes a number of recommendations including evacuating problematic workplaces, facilitating greater homeworking, auditing call centres and the implementation of appropriate health and safety and testing measures; and calls on the Government to reflect on the evidence and recommendations in that report and consider what actions it can take to help protect call centre workers throughout the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the decision to reinstate benefit sanctions in the middle of a health and economic crisis is a profoundly callous step; further believes that this is an ideologically driven, punitive measure which simply adds to the stress and anxiety for people who are already facing hard times; notes that removing benefits and forcing people to use food banks to feed their families does nothing to help anyone back to work; and urgently calls on the Government to extend the suspension of sanctions as the covid-19 crisis continues and the numbers claiming universal credit soar, with a view to scrapping benefit sanctions altogether.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the vast cuts to news media jobs in Wales; further notes that more than seventy journalists working at Media Wales, which publishes the Western Mail, South Wales Echo and South Wales Evening Post,  have been notified that their jobs are currently on a redundancy at risk list; is distressed that staff at the Daily Post newspaper in North Wales are also at risk of significant job losses; is alarmed that Newsquest is losing twenty five dedicated staff while BBC Cymru Wales is expecting to make sixty people redundant; further notes with concern the devastating impact those decisions will have in muting the voice of the Welsh press and media in a critical time where the people of Wales require direct, relevant and clear information on contentious political issues the most; acknowledges the importance of the Welsh media in reflecting the values and the diversity of life in Wales; and asserts that that can only be achieved through committing to a sustained, adequately sized media workforce.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the acts of aggression by Armenia overnight on 12 July 2020 which further escalates the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan which is rooted in Armenia&apos;s military control over Azerbaijan&apos;s Nagorno Karabakh region and adjacent seven districts that in the early 1990s led to the death of 30,000 people and the fleeing of more than 1 million internally displaced persons from their homes; calls on the UK Government to condemn the recent actions of Armenia which represent a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process and which have violated international law as well as the ceasefire agreement signed in 1994; further notes that the military flare up along the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan with the involvement of heavy artillery is a flagrant violation of international law as well as the ceasefire agreed in 1994 and represents a serious hindrance to the progress of the peace process; urges the UK Government to support the call for the OSCE Minsk Group to investigate thoroughly to prevent the current military action escalating into an all-out war; and further calls on the UK Government to urge for the withdrawal of Armenian military forces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan as stated in UN Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Beijing Treaty on Audio-Visual Performances which came into force on 28 April 2020; notes that the aim of that Treaty is to extend the economic and moral rights of actors and performers in audio-visual performances including films, videos and television programs; is concerned that not all signatories who have ratified that Treaty have done so in ways that are consistent with that aim; recognises the importance of the audio-visual industry to the UK economy and the integral role played by audio-visual performers who enrich our daily lives with their craft; considers that ratifying the Treaty in such a way as to allow for the economic and moral rights of actors and performers to be immediately transferred to the producer undermines a performer’s remuneration right; understands the importance of the concept of national treatment to secure revenues from usage of work in other countries; calls on the Government to enable an early ratification of the Beijing Treaty in line with that Treaty’s clearly stated aims; and further calls on the Government to undertake early talks with secondary users to ensure a fair and affordable system for upholding performers’ rights.</p>
