# Existing HTML

This folder contains existing HTML that has come straight out of InDesign. The HTML should be transformed (using python) and the output should go in the demo folder.

You can use the cp command to bulk copy files into this location e.g.
```bash
# make sure you are in the business-papers dir first
cp ~/UK\ Parliament/PPU\ -\ Publications/Votes_and_Proceedings/Vote\ 19-20/2020/*/*200*/2003??.html ./existingHTML/
```
