			<p>That this House notes that an estimated 60 per cent of recipients of homecare and 70 per cent of care home residents live with dementia; acknowledges that dementia is a condition caused by diseases of the brain with complex support needs that should be met by the NHS, like any other health condition; recognises that the typical cost of dementia care of &#163;100,000 can be financially devastating for individuals and families; welcomes the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society&#8217;s proposal for a Dementia Fund as a financial injection into the social care system in the short-to-medium term, allowing for greater provision of safe and quality care for people with dementia, longer visits for people with dementia and savings to the NHS; believes that this could be financed through unallocated funding for community and preventative support in the NHS Long Term Plan; and urges the Government to include a Dementia Fund in the forthcoming Budget to break the deadlock on reforming the social care system and end the unfairness facing people with dementia, as well as supporting Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK&#8217;s Delivering the Dementia Moonshot report recommendations to find cures and treatments for all forms of dementia.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the previous Government&#8217;s plans to extend the off-payroll (IR35) changes to the private sector, despite the damage that this has done to the public sector including the NHS; further notes that the off-payroll tax means a 14.3 per cent extra cost on UK business made up of National Insurance and the Apprenticeship Levy; believes that this will damage the UK&#8217;s flexible workforce and the UK economy, driving up project costs and depriving businesses of access to key skills; notes that firms are already laying off self-employed contractors and that others are looking to offshore resource to avoid the extra costs; further notes that HMRC estimate that 153,000 UK contractors could lose up 25 per cent of their pay and that thousands of contractors will be asked to pay their clients employment tax bills, without getting the benefits of employment such as sick and holiday pay and a pension contribution; is concerned that the off-payroll tax will lead to tax non-compliance and the danger of people being lured into avoidance schemes, as happened with those now facing the loan charge; welcomes the commitment made by the Chancellor to hold an IR35 review made during the election, but believes this is will only be a genuine review if the roll-out is halted; and therefore calls for an immediate halt to the off-payroll tax roll-out and announcement of an independent review looking into how best to recognise contracting and freelancing in the tax system..</p>

			<p>That this House notes that in 1998 members of the Foreign Affairs, Trade, Defence and International Development Committees met together to scrutinise the Government's annual report on arms exports; further notes that this arrangement has been repeated annually and gradually became more formalised as the Committees on Arms Exports Controls (CAEC); expresses concern that, at a time when arms exports were an issue of major public interest, the CAEC in the last Parliament, as technically comprising four separate Committees, found it difficult to hold a quorate meeting; and calls for the establishment of a Committee on Arms Export Controls as a full non-departmental Select Committee, as was one of the recommendations from the 2017-19 CAEC, with an elected chair, members dedicated to it and adequate staffing so as to enable it to give effective scrutiny to a major cross-departmental issue.</p>
