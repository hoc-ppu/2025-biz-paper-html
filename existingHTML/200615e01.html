			<p>That this House notes with disgust the front page of The Sun newspaper on Friday 12 June 2020; believes that it is irresponsible to give such a prominent platform to unrepentant accounts of domestic violence; further believes that the media has an important role to play in combating domestic abuse by enabling survivors to tell their stories and highlighting the ongoing need for greater Government action; calls on the Independent Press Standards Organisation to publish and enforce robust guidelines on the reporting of domestic violence to ensure that survivors have their dignity fully respected; and further calls on The Sun to apologise and donate all its revenue from that edition to the charity Refuge.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>
			<p>That this House recognises World Blood Donor Day 2020; notes that men who have had sexual contact with other men in the last three months are excluded from donating blood; calls on the Government to work with the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs on reviewing the current blood donation policy; affirms the importance of donating blood, with just one visit capable of saving up to three lives; and asserts that the ability to donate blood, which could be used to help find a cure for covid-19, should be assessed on a case by case basis and reviewed based on the most thorough and up to date medical evidence.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bob Blackman</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the important role which housing-with-care settings such as extra care and retirement villages play in the social care system and the particular contribution those settings have made to protecting the health and well-being of their residents during the coronavirus crisis and towards reducing strain on the NHS and care homes; notes the need for a significant expansion of housing-with-care provision for older people; and further notes how such an expansion would help the UK better manage future similar health crises; and calls on the Government to promote measures which will ensure the expansion of that sector.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Christine Jardine</p>
			<p>That this House notes that there are an estimated 26 million refugees and 3.5 million asylum seekers around the world today; celebrates the successful resettlement of 20,000 refugees in the UK since 2014 under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS); notes that the Government committed to resettle a further 3,000 refugees under the Vulnerable Children&#8217;s Resettlement Scheme (VCRS) by 2020, but that as of 31st March 2020 only 1,826 people had been resettled under the VCRS, including just 1,055 children; regrets that the Government has not yet set out details of the new global resettlement programme it has announced to replace the VPRS, VCRS and the Gateway Protection Programme; further regrets that the Government has not made a new commitment to relocate unaccompanied refugee children from elsewhere in Europe following the closure of the scheme under Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016; believes that the UK must continue to provide safe, legal routes to sanctuary for refugees; and calls on the Government to urgently set out a new long-term commitment to continue resettling vulnerable refugees in the UK and to commit to resettling a further 10,000 refugee children from elsewhere in Europe over the next 10 years.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the work of Marcus Rashford and FareShare; notes their exceptional fundraising efforts that have seen thousands of meals distributed to school children who would normally be entitled to free school meals; further notes Mr Rashford's powerful letter to all Members of this House dated 15 June 2020 which highlights the 200,000 children that will have to miss a meal due to their parents not being able to access food during the covid-19 lockdown; notes with that regret that 45 per cent of BAME children now live in poverty; is concerned that school children across England are forced to go hungry with many families relying on food banks; calls on the Prime Minister to meet with Mr Rashford, representatives of FareShare and children who are entitled to free school meals as soon as possible; and urges the Government to bring forward a scheme to provide provision for children who would normally receive free school meals over the summer holidays.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Clive Lewis</p>
			<p>This this House is concerned to learn the important BBC regional programme Inside Out East  is under threat as the corporation seeks to make cuts to programming; understands that regional segments of Politics East are similarly threatened; regrets that all filming of these award-winning BBC regional current affairs programmes has been postponed and the programmes look likely to be shelved following an internal review expected by the end of June 2020; notes that Inside Out is a unique programme, rooted in the heart of our communities, investigating and holding those in power to account and telling remarkable stories of life across the region; further notes that that programme has helped to bring issues of public concern to national attention, serving a valuable function in the democratic life at local authority and constituency-wide level; and supports the call of the National Union of Journalists for the BBC to rethink the proposals to cut those vital, local current affairs programmes.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the generous donation of &#163;3.1m from Edinburgh-based philanthropist James Anderson to help support professional Scottish football clubs and their surrounding communities; acknowledges that the fund will help teams pay wages, bills and contribute towards the cost of testing players for dovid-19 when training and competitive games return, as well as support other charitable objectives within the SPFL community; observes that the return of sport, and football in particular, will help raise the nation&#8217;s spirit during this very difficult period; recognises the difficulties faced by Scottish football; and commends James Anderson for providing that support with no conditions with the promise of more to follow if required.</p>

			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>
			<p>Below are EDMs tabled in the last two weeks to which names have been added. Only the first 6 names and any new names are included.</p>
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">521</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>UK law on disability-selective abortion</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	2/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	31</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carla Lockhart</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Gregory Campbell</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Andrew Selous</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Angela Crawley</span></p>
			<p>That this House praises the 6.5 million people in the UK who are carers; recognises the importance of Carers Week, which takes place from 8 June 2020 to 14 June 2020 in celebrating and raising awareness of the work and dedication of carers; notes the challenges that unpaid carers face; stresses the importance of Making Caring Visible and the need for more support for carers, as carers are seven times more likely to say they are lonely than the general population; further praises Lanarkshire Carers Centre for the support that organisation gives to carers, especially during the covid-19 outbreak; thanks Lanarkshire Carers Centre for checking on the wellbeing of carers and delivering practical and emotional support to carers, providing funding to carers so that they can access vital equipment and offering a course to carers around grief and bereavement so that carers can learn about coping mechanisms; acknowledges Lanarkshire Carers Centre&#8217;s mission to ensure that carers in Lanarkshire are well informed, involved, supported and empowered; and expresses immense gratitude to carers in Lanarkshire and across the UK for the incredible work they do all year-round, and for their fortitude and strength during the covid-19 outbreak.</p>

			<p>That this House strongly condemns the ongoing attempts of the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) to evict the Sumarin family from their home in East Jerusalem; recognises this within a broader context of the Israeli government&#8217;s efforts to demographically alter the population of Jerusalem, and the controversial use of Israel&#8217;s Absentee Property Law to dispossess Palestinians of their land; notes the Sumarin family have lived at their property, with deeds of ownership, for over fifty years; reiterates that ethnic cleansing is one of the most serious crimes, and that the UK is committed to upholding international law; urgently requests the Government to intervene on behalf of the Sumarin family, and calls on the Charity Commission to review the charitable status of JNF UK.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Martyn Day</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Neale Hanvey</span></p>
			<p>That this House commends the Minister for Business, Energy, and Clean Growth&#8217;s decision to spread the distribution costs of electric energy to Shetland across the whole of the UK; acknowledges that both the telecoms and gas networks have dominant suppliers yet the distribution costs are shared equally by their customers across the UK; further acknowledges that households in the far north are paying disproportionately high distribution costs on electric energy; notes that no access to mains gas means that those living in the Highlands have no choice but to use electric energy which is more than three times more expensive than gas energy; notes that 90 per cent of households in Caithness and Sutherland are living in fuel poverty and are, as a result, often forced to choose between heating and eating during the winter months; calls on the Government to replace the current electricity distribution system with one that replicates that of gas and telecoms and share the cost of energy distribution equally across the UK.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Neale Hanvey</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that SSE is the incumbent energy supplier to the far north; further notes that communities are unable to sell clean, renewable energy that they generate to local people; acknowledges that this is blocking the remarkable potential for new community energy companies to emerge across the country and is also negatively contributing to fuel poverty in rural constituencies such as the Highlands; notes that local energy businesses must sell any excess energy back to SSE before local people can purchase it back at 10 times the price that local energy businesses could have originally sold it to them for; notes that if local energy business could sell directly to local people then it would benefit consumers with cheaper electricity, the environment with more renewable energy schemes, investors and the local economy; and calls on the Government to institute the right to local supply which would make the cost of selling local energy proportionate to the scale of a local supplier&#8217;s business.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Government action on axing the reading tax on e-books to bring the rate of VAT in line with print books; notes with concern that audiobooks still carry the full rate of VAT; believes that audiobooks are vital for millions of people in the UK with visual impairments, dyslexia or other reading disabilities and should not be treated as a luxury; notes that many European countries have recently adjusted their rates of VAT on audiobooks and e-books to bring them into line with the treatment of physical books; and calls on the Government to immediately review the VAT treatment of audiobooks and to bring forward legislation to remove VAT from audiobooks in a timely fashion.</p>
