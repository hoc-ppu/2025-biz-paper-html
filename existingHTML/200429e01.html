			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	29/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that despite a sharp drop in trade due to the covid-19 pandemic, the Government&#8217;s &#163;17 million support package for ferry services does not include the Holyhead &#8211; Dublin route; notes that as the UK&#8217;s second roll on roll off port Holyhead is critical for the Welsh and UK economies with in excess of a million vehicle movements a year; recalls that it is also a vital route for the Northern Ireland economy; further notes that the port of Holyhead sustains more than 400 jobs and many hundreds more through its supply chain; and urges the Government to provide financial support to the port of Holyhead as it does to other UK ports, and to work with both the Welsh and Irish governments to safeguard its future beyond the covid-19 crisis.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Liz Saville Roberts</p>
			<p>That this House is alarmed that 25 per cent of confirmed covid-19 cases in prisons in England and Wales have been in Welsh facilities, despite only having 6 per cent of the prison population; is concerned that the number of people held in Welsh prisons reached its highest ever level in March 2020 and that HMP Swansea was the most overcrowded prison in England and Wales; is further concerned that as of 28 April, only thirty-three out of 4,000 prisoners eligible for temporary release to help tackle covid-19 have so far been released, and that the number of prisoners who will be temporarily released from Welsh establishments has not been finalised; calls on the Ministry of Justice to urgently release more of those eligible for temporary release in order to stop the rapid spread of the virus in our prison system; and stresses that those being released must pose no risk to the public and must get tested for covid-19 prior to release.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Liz Saville Roberts</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ben Lake</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the unprecedented impact of covid-19 on the maritime economy; supports the RMT trade union&#8217;s proposals for protecting UK maritime workers from the long-term economic effects of the coronavirus crisis; calls for no compulsory redundancies of UK seafarers, dock or port workers during or after the covid-19 crisis; urges the Government to ensure that furlough and cash flow support payments only go to shipping companies that state their commitment to long term investment in employment and training for UK seafarers; demands reform of the UK Ship Register and the end Red Ensign Group to restore the link with employment for domestic Ratings and Officers in order to limit the possibility of companies and individuals to avoid tax liabilities and use low-cost labour; requests increased public funding for training and developing UK Ratings; and urges the Government to implement these necessary measures to build a resilient and stable maritime future.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">405</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Emergency powers in Hungary</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	29/04/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Stephen Farry</p>
			<p>That this House notes Viktor Orb&#225;n and the Hungarian Government&#8217;s exploitation of the covid-19 pandemic to put in place emergency powers that effectively undermine democracy and the rule of law in Hungary; stresses that any emergency measures must be temporary and proportionate, denounces the actions to suppress human rights and expresses its concern for the rights of transgender people and other vulnerable groups in Hungary; calls on the UK Government to take every opportunity to challenge the actions of the Hungarian Government.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>
			<p>That this house notes that hospitality and the UK tourism industry are among the hardest hit by the necessary social distancing policies in place during the covid-19 outbreak; further notes that 80 per cent of workers in the hotel and food industries are furloughed and up to a third may be at risk in the longer term of losing their jobs; recognises that in the Lake District 80 per cent of the working population are employed in tourism or hospitality; further recognises research from Cumbria Tourism indicating that the cost of coronavirus in Cumbria may reach &#163;1.45 billion by May 2020, translating into 18,459 job losses; further notes that the seasonal nature of the tourism industry means that many businesses will not be able to generate the necessary level of income to avoid closing down after the support packages end; and calls on the Government to introduce a 12 month financial support package to secure the survival of the UK tourism and hospitality industry until the summer of 2021.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p>That this house congratulates Bryan Leslie from Gullane Tennis Club on winning the Volunteer of the Year Award and congratulates the East Lothian Open at North Berwick Tennis Club on winning Competition of the Year; notes that the announcement was made in April 2020 as part of The Tennis Scotland Awards to recognise the many people and organisations that have contributed to tennis in Scotland in 2019; understands that both winners will go on to be shortlisted for the Lawn Tennis Association awards, covering the whole of Great Britain and aims to celebrate the wonderful contribution of those people and venues through bringing tennis to new people and places from volunteers to officials; and wishes all the best in the Lawn Tennis Association competition and in the years to come.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Owen Thompson</p>
			<p>That this house congratulates Newtongrange Community 1st on receiving a National Lottery Award from the National Lottery Community Fund to help support their local community throughout the ongoing covid-19 outbreak; applauds the selfless and hugely important work being done by Newtongrange Community 1st to prepare and deliver food and fresh meals to vulnerable people shielding or self-isolating with no other means of support; recognises that the award will help with the practical and emotional needs of the community, as well as helping to facilitate community events and activities once restrictions are eased in order to bring the community closer once again; and thanks volunteers and community groups throughout Midlothian for stepping up to help their communities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Robert Halfon</p>
			<p>That this House warmly congratulates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq, as it lifts the lockdown, for its concerted measures that have so far contained the spread of coronavirus in a population of about 6 million people to 347 cases and four deaths; notes that the KRG carries 70 per cent of the burden of the nearly $1 billion annual cost for providing basic services to over a million internally displaced people and refugees from Syria, many in camps, and who account for one fifth of the population; further recognises that sharp decreases in oil prices present grave difficulties given that Kurdistan and Iraq rely so heavily on oil revenues; hopes that the Iraqi government and the KRG can soon reach a long-term agreement on oil and revenue-sharing; and urges the caretaker government in Baghdad not to proceed with plans to cut federal subventions to the Kurdistan Region.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Clive Betts</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Catherine McKinnell</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House expresses its gratitude for the hard work of local authorities in helping to ensure that vulnerable groups are protected during the covid-19 pandemic; recognises the vital role that local authorities are playing in the co-ordination and running of local support groups that distribute food and medication and identify vulnerable people within the community; and calls on the Government to provide the necessary financial support and urgently clarify how and when that support will be distributed.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with disappointment the announcement on 16 April 2020 by the UK&#8217;s chief Brexit negotiator that the UK Government intends to refuse to extend the EU exit transition period beyond December 2020, risking a no-deal Brexit during a time that the UK, Europe and much of the world will be trying to recover from the public health and economic shock of Covid-19; recognises that the design and delivery of an entirely new arrangement between the UK and the EU will be extremely challenging in the midst of the current crisis; notes that coming out of the transition period without a trade deal during this time when there is already concern around supply of food, medicine and essential equipment could further disrupt vital supply chains; recognises the particular damaging impact this would have on Northern Ireland, risking disruption of all-island co-operation; and calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the EU exit transition period.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">346</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Non-essential travel during the covid-19 pandemic</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ben Lake</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House expresses its gratitude to the vast majority of people who are respecting guidelines on social distancing and non-essential travel in relation to covid-19; is however concerned about continuing reports of people travelling to rural areas to visit holiday homes and holiday lets; and urges the Government to legislate to introduce higher penalties of at least &#163;1000 to those repeatedly breaking rules.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">347</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Extended cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House expresses concern about the extended cut-off date for employees to receive support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, after the eligibility date was extended from 28 February to 19 March; acknowledges that although this extension will allow more employees to now be furloughed following the changes to the Government scheme a large number of workers will still miss out because they are paid towards the end of each month; further notes that all workers who can be furloughed will need to have been on the payroll and the employer would need to have sent to HM Revenue &amp; Customs a real-time information submission notifying a payment in respect of those employees on or before 19 March 2020; believes that this move will not cover people who were not put on the Pay As You Earn system until after the pay cut-off date; and calls on the Government to consider further extending the cut-off date for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to include this large proportion of workers who are paid monthly and the opportunity for more new employees to be furloughed.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kevin Brennan</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">John Spellar</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that sky lanterns, also known as Chinese lanterns, continue to pose a serious fire safety hazard due to their uncontrolled and unpredictable flight paths, and are dangerous to livestock, wildlife, crops and the environment; that these hazards are exacerbated in rural areas in summer; further notes that the voluntary code on their use is not being universally respected; and calls on the Government to introduce an outright ban on flame-powered sky lanterns.</p>

			<p>That this House commends the Chancellor&#8217;s job retention schemes to help the employed and the self-employed during the covid-19 outbreak; in addition acknowledges that thousands of people working in a creative freelance capacity are excluded from those schemes; notes that directors of small limited companies that are often comprised of one person cannot access either scheme; further notes that, because of the way the arts industry typically functions, these people usually pay themselves a low salary and rely heavily on dividends; further acknowledges that this means that receiving 80 per cent of their salary, as offered by the schemes set out by the Chancellor, is not enough to live on; and calls on the Government to close the loophole in the job retention schemes by allowing small limited company directors to claim for 80 per cent of filed average earnings, including dividends.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that, for those workers covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it is providing an essential safety net for many workers and their families during this crisis, ensuring businesses can maintain their workforce and enabling them to re-open in the future; notes that the Resolution Foundation estimates that 8 million workers could be furloughed under that scheme; further notes that that whilst Government is funding 80 per cent of the payroll for furloughed staff, employers are not obliged under terms of the scheme to top up the remaining 20 per cent to ensure no loss of pay; remains concerned about the financial impact on workers of receiving only 80 per cent of their usual take home pay, an impact which is particularly difficult for those on low pay; and therefore urges highly profitable corporations like McDonald&#8217;s, KFC, and JD Wetherspoons that have made millions  from the labour of those same workers to step up and pay the remaining 20 per cent to ensure that their workers are not forced into debt and further poverty as a result of this significant cut in pay.</p>

			<p>This House welcomes the decision by the Danish authorities to exempt companies that are registered in tax havens from Government aid programmes; notes that it is unfair to taxpayers for the UK Government to support companies who have increased their profits by circumventing the domestic tax regime; and calls on the UK Government to urgently review its support mechanisms and ensure exemption for companies registered in tax havens from any UK Government aid programmes, including publicly naming the exempted companies.</p>
