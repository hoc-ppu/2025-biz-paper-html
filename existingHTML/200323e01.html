			<p>That this House notes that there is an urgent need for national action to stave off food insecurity during the covid-19 outbreak; and calls on the Government to take the following steps to deal with food insecurity: to provide immediate support to all voluntary and mutual-aid organisations currently working to tackle food insecurity in their communities as the private sector has shown itself unable to distribute food in a time of crisis, and thus mutual aid networks have rapidly grown to distribute the resources needed to ensure that communities are effectively supported in the coming weeks; to maximise capacity and stimulate food distribution and essential aid by reducing barriers to accessing food; to grant emergency resources to community support groups to ensure they are funded immediately and maintain their momentum and organisation over the coming weeks; and to protect community spaces during the pandemic and increase access to community and publicly owned kitchen facilities and unused spaces by freezing all rent and bills and making them available for use by community organisations in the distribution of food and resources.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Virendra Sharma</p>
			<p>That this House recognises World TB Day which takes place on 24 March 2020; notes that 10 million people fall ill with TB every year with 4,000 deaths each day; further recognises that the communities most affected by TB, both in the UK and globally, are often the most vulnerable and marginalised; remains concerned that three in 10 people with TB are unable to access quality diagnosis and treatment; notes that these conditions are likely to be significantly worsened as a result of the coronavirus pandemic both for people affected by TB and their communities more broadly; recognises the strain caused by stigma, catastrophic costs and social isolation on responses to TB and infectious diseases more broadly; welcomes the UK Government&#8217;s existing commitments to strengthening global health through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and Nutrition for Growth, as well as investments in research, and political leadership through the UN, WHO and G7 and G20; voices its steadfast support for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and their commitment to leave no-one behind; commits itself to supporting their delivery; expresses its solidarity with all people around the world; and calls on the Government to work in partnership to ensure equitable and resilient health systems and develop accessible new medical tools to end preventable deaths and to protect the human rights, dignity and well-being of all people around the world.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Neale Hanvey</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the achievements of Kirkcaldy&#8217;s Rachael Nixon who has sold hundreds of hats and headpieces around the world since setting up her creative business, Chanix Millinery, and who was recently announced as No.1 Scotland Magazine Business Innovator of the Year; further notes that Rachael also achieved Fife Visual Artist and Craft Maker Award and was a finalist for Best Wedding Accessory Provider at Scottish Wedding Awards 2020; congratulates Rachael on the success of her business since going full-time last summer, having previously juggled her creative enterprise with nursing children at Rachel House hospice in Kinross; and wishes Rachael and Chanix Millinery continued success.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Apsana Begum</p>
			<p>This House expresses concern at reports that some retailers are inflating the prices of products in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak; notes that the Competition and Markets Authority has urged businesses to behave responsibly and not increase prices in response to the covid-19 crisis; applauds the actions of retailers who have not inflated prices and those that have proactively taken measures to support their customers and local community at this difficult time; believes that while many businesses are striving to do the right thing under very challenging circumstances, the continued behaviour of those seeking to capitalise on the current situation by charging unjustifiably high prices for essential goods is immoral and unjust; and urges the Government to take action to price rises as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Neil Gray</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates Commonwealth Day and the shared goals and bonds between Commonwealth nations, but regrets that half a million UK pensioners living overseas in so-called frozen countries, of which over 90 per cent are Commonwealth nations, are suffering unfairly because the value of their pension is frozen and not up-rated annually in line with inflation, plunging thousands of UK pensioners including veterans and former public servants into poverty; and calls on the Government to uprate the pensions of all UK pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mary Glindon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rachel Hopkins</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges recent research conducted by YouGov which demonstrates that 62 per cent of parents believe there is too much standardised assessment in primary schools in England; notes that parents consider the happiness of pupils and a well-rounded education to be a better measure of the performance of schools than formal tests taken under exam conditions; further notes that teaching to the test can limit children's access to a broad and balanced curriculum and restrict time spent on activities which children would find stimulating and challenging; further expresses concern that the pressure of sitting tests under exam conditions can harm pupils' well-being and have negative consequences both in school and at home; and calls for an urgent Government review of all assessment in primary schools to achieve a system of standardised accountability which is in line with parents' priorities.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wendy Chamberlain</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement to allow employed parents of premature and sick babies to to claim up to 12 weeks Neonatal Leave and Pay; recognises the positive impact this will have for thousands of families every year; understands that over 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care every year leading to many parents using their maternity or paternity leave before getting them home; notes around 1 in 4 working men do not currently qualify for paternity leave; understands that this limits parental involvement in their baby's care despite this being essential for babies&#8217; to have the best developmental outcomes; notes having a baby in neonatal care has been shown to negatively affect parents&#8217; mental health with some studies reporting up to 40 per cent of mothers of preterm babies showing signs of post-natal depression compared to 10 per cent of mothers generally; further notes that neonatal care is expensive with parents reporting additional costs of over &#163;280 for every week their baby is in neonatal care at a time when their household income is reduced; and calls on the Government to introduce these welcome proposals swiftly with consideration for parents who do not currently qualify for parental leave rights due to being self-employed or a worker.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Caroline Lucas</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of quality local journalism; commends those who dedicate their working lives to serving the public by reporting important, timely and accurate information that is in the public interest; notes the importance of media reporting and how it helps to maintain local transparency and accountability and supports the health of democracy at a local level; celebrates that, from reporting on floods or courts, to covering significant community events and issues, the work done by local journalists is essential in sustaining public life; and therefore resolves to support the National Union of Journalists' Local News Matters campaign, and further consider ways in which additional investment, resources and support for local journalism can be encouraged in order to protect the future viability and sustainability of local quality news.</p>

			<p>That this House urges the UK Government to immediately request an extension to the transition period and to suspend negotiations with the EU until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to 1 or 2 years; believes that public health professionals&#8217; advice for self-isolation will inevitably reduce the capacity of the Civil Service to negotiate a future agreement as well as its ability to replace European frameworks and agencies; recalls that the Prime Minister said in a statement on 12 March that there will be severe disruption across our country for many months; calls on the Government to minimise uncertainty for people and businesses during the outbreak; and further calls on the UK Government to work closely with other European governments in responding to the pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the serious impact of the downturn in economic activity due to the steps taken to deal with the covid-19 virus and its consequences, in particular the self-employed and freelance workers; and calls on the Government to use emergency legislation to introduce a temporary basic income aimed at supporting people who are self-employed, freelance or independent and who may not otherwise be covered by the employment support package which the Government has promised to introduce to help people through this crisis.</p>
