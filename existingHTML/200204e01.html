			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Evans</p>
			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights World Wetlands Day and the tremendous work that is carried out by the Wetlands Trust every day of the year; notes the importance of the fact that 40 per cent of all species live or breed in Wetlands and that peatlands store 30 per cent of land based carbon; and thanks all of those who tend to and enhance biodiversity and give the time and resources to make a real difference to the environment in this way.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the Government has for over two decades failed women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of the changes that were made to their state pension age due to equalisation brought on by the Pensions Act 1995; regrets that the Government only began writing to women affected from 2009 onward; acknowledges that the Scottish National Party previously submitted a fully funded proposal to help women born in the 1950s that was rejected by the Government; believes the onus is now on the Government to remedy the injustices suffered by millions of women across the UK; and calls on the Government to oversee a full impact assessment, which takes into account the wide reaching effects of its policy, and to make a decision on the recompense that affected women will receive based on the findings of such an assessment.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mary Glindon</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned that Government cuts to local government funding are reducing the ability for arts and culture to improve society&#8217;s health and wellbeing; notes that this lack of investment undermines health care professional's capability to deliver effective social prescribing initiatives through wider community groups which can provide emotional and practical support to those dealing with loneliness, mental health issues and complex social needs; further notes that social prescribing can improve health and wellbeing while simultaneously reducing the pressure on clinical health care services; and calls on the Government to increase investment in social prescribing as part of its public health strategy.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the decision taken on 10 January 2020 by the United Nations Security Council to cut back essential humanitarian aid to Northern Syria, a decision which exposes four million people to the prospect of a devastating lack of basic daily food stuffs and medicines; is troubled that two of the four access points to Northern Syria for aid have been closed; notes that all aid will now have to cross through the border with Turkey or direct from Government held areas; further notes that the UN Secretary General has stated that the previous programme of aid to Northern Syria was essential; raises concerns that Kurdish people of Syria will be disproportionately affected because of the policies of the Turkish State towards the Kurdish areas, many of which are now under Turkish occupation; and calls for the United Nations Security Council to reverse this dangerous decision and for all parties to fulfil their obligations under international law, and to broker a negotiated settlement which protects the rights of all people irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the inauguration of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong to promote democracy and the rule of law, and to defend human rights in Hong Kong, to share information about Hong Kong, and to nurture relations between the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong; notes that the inaugural meeting heard chilling testimony from a consultant surgeon who provides humanitarian aid to those injured in the protests, including police, protestors and bystanders, and who reported having treated the kind of injuries seen in wars; is profoundly concerned by reports of the arrest and public humiliation of those providing medical assistance to the injured; observes that video footage of police brutality demonstrates that the Hong Kong police are failing to adhere to the provisions of the United Nations Guidance on Less Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement; further observes that the arrest of those providing humanitarian assistance is contrary to international law and the global consensus on fundamental human rights of access to medical treatment; is alarmed that failure of the international community to condemn these breaches by the Hong Kong police would set a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to follow suit, placing in grave jeopardy the lives and welfare of humanitarian aid workers around the world, including providers of medical and other aid from the United Kingdom; and calls on the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to raise these concerns with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that there are thousands of unaccompanied child refugees throughout Europe living in desperate circumstances; welcomes the Government&#8217;s statement that it will ensure unaccompanied children will continue to be able to come to the UK to join a relative; notes with concern the removal of that protection from the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2019-20; further notes that the removal of legal protections for separated child refugees may lead to more children undertaking dangerous journeys in order to be reunited with their families; and calls on the Government to enshrine its commitment in law to ensure the ongoing protection of those vulnerable children and their right to reunification with their families.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises and celebrates the importance of vibrant oceans to our global ecosystem; notes that our oceans are facing a variety of threats, including large amounts of waste of all kinds being disposed of in them, overfishing and human caused climate change, and that the creatures within them are especially vulnerable to even slight changes in global temperatures; regrets that studies have found that only 13 per cent of the ocean has been unharmed by human activity, that 50 per cent of global coral has died since 1980, that 72 marine species are listed as critically endangered, and that over a third of marine mammal species face extinction; recalls the work of the Blue Belt Programme in UK Overseas Territories; welcomes the Greenpeace Ocean Declaration on the ongoing negotiations towards a Global Ocean Treaty and calls upon the Government to be bold in pursuing meaningful negotiations to establish, significantly expand and enforce global ocean sanctuaries, and to drive a global shift towards a collaborative, but also effective, global decision making process to help protect global oceans.</p>

			<p>That this House commends successful businessman Julian Richer for launching the Zero Hours Justice campaign to provide advice and legal support for workers forced to work on a zero hours basis; believes that good employers recognise that their staff deserve financial security and the ability budget effectively from week to week; notes that responsible employers have no difficulty in offering workers the option of contracts which offer them a guaranteed minimum number of paid hours each week; is concerned that the use of zero hours contracts can deter workers from raising serious abuses in the workplace including bullying, sexual harassment and health and safety breaches; and calls on all public bodies to eliminate the use of exploitative zero hours contracts, both for directly-employed and privately-contracted workers.</p>

			<p>This House supports the growth of electric vehicle sales; notes that Government funded grants for electric cars have been running since 2011 and that battery electric vehicles now represent 1.6 per cent of new car sales in the UK; further notes that those grants are due to end in March 2020 and that when the Government grant for plug-in hybrid cars ended in April last year sales fell by 50 per cent; recognises that in 2020 carmakers do not need to sell electric vehicles in the UK market to meet their EU targets and that if the grant is removed, those companies would be incentivised to instead sell their vehicles where market conditions are easier and grants are available; further recognises the importance of those grants for public health and reaching net-zero emissions; and calls upon the Government to continue grants for electric cars in the March 2020 Budget for a further five years and to invest in charging infrastructure.</p>
