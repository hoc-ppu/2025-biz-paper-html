			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bob Blackman</p>
			<p>That this House celebrates the 6th International Day of Yoga on 21 June 2020, first adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015 with the unprecedented support of 177 countries; notes that, at a time when we are recovering from a worldwide pandemic, the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in proposing this annual international event in 2014, have a great relevance - Yoga is an invaluable gift of India&#8217;s ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body, harmony between man and nature, a holistic approach to health and well-being, a means to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature; further notes that extensive medical research has shown that yoga has proven health benefits for a wide range of physical and mental problems; asserts that yoga is an effective means of maintaining good health and preventing ill health and offers a sustainable and cost-effective means for people to take care of themselves; recognises that yoga empowers patients and restores them as agents of their own health and healing; urges that yoga be included in the prevention and well-being initiatives within the National Health Service both for patients and for staff; and calls on the Government to introduce a Chair of Yoga in all medical schools so that the rising generation of medical students gain a thorough grounding in this traditional and timeless knowledge of health and wellbeing.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned to learn the important BBC regional programme Inside Out North East and Cumbria is under threat as the corporation seeks to make cuts to programming; understands that regional segments of the Politics North East and Cumbria are similarly threatened; regrets that all filming of these award-winning BBC regional current affairs programmes have been postponed and these programmes look likely to be shelved following an internal review expected by the end of June 2020; notes that Inside Out is a unique programme, rooted in the heart of our communities, investigating and holding those in power to account and telling remarkable stories of life across the region; further notes that the programme has helped to bring issues of public concern to national attention, serving a valuable function in the democratic life at local authority and constituency-wide level; and supports the call of the National Union of Journalists for the BBC to rethink the proposals to cut those vital, local current affairs programmes.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Girvan</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Carla Lockhart</p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the launch of the APPG for International Freedom of Religion or Belief&#8217;s new report entitled, Nigeria: Unfolding Genocide; condemns the devastating violence that Nigerian Christians have experienced due to attacks by armed groups of Islamist Fulani herders which are described in that report; deeply regrets that these attacks have killed over 1,000 Christians between January and November 2019, over 6,000 Christians since 2015 and have displaced over 300,000 people; notes that on 4 July 2018, the Nigerian House of Representatives declared killings in predominantly-Christian villages in Plateau State to be a genocide and called on the Nigerian Federal Government to immediately establish orphanages in areas affected by violence; recognises that the key factors driving that violence include resource competition, the influence of politics, criminality, the ready availability of firearms, the spread of misinformation and the impact of the growing power and influence of Islamist extremism across the Sahel which drives some Fulani herders to target Christians and symbols of Christian identity such as churches; further notes that those factors are compounded by the Nigerian Government&#8217;s failure to respond adequately to the violence, to protect communities or to bring perpetrators of violence to justice; and urges the Government of Nigeria and the international community to implement the recommendations outlined in that report to tackle that violence which has claimed the lives of six times more people than the conflict with Boko Haram and is costing the Nigerian economy at least &#163;10.5 billion per year.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kate Osborne</p>
			<p>That this House expresses sincere gratitude for the work that those in the public sector have undertaken during the covid-19 pandemic; acknowledges the sacrifices that those people have made and how they have gone beyond their call of duty both emotionally and physically; and calls on the Government to give all public sector workers a proper pay rise in the next Budget.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with surprise and concern the decision by HSBC Bank Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to support China&#8217;s proposals for a new National Security Law in Hong Kong; recognises that financial institutions, particularly those enjoying the benefits and protections of being based in the UK, have a duty to uphold and promote democratic principles and human rights around the world, wherever they may trade; warns that the proposed National Security Law is likely to be in direct breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration; and calls on the Government to set out the measures it will take to encourage HSBC and Standard Chartered to review their support for that proposed legislation from the Chinese Communist Party, which has a serial record of violating human rights and undermining democratic principles.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">521</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>UK law on disability-selective abortion</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	2/06/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	32</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Gregory Campbell</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mhairi Black</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Colum Eastwood</span><span class="signatory">Steven Bonnar</span></p>
			<p>That this House strongly condemns the ongoing attempts of the Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) to evict the Sumarin family from their home in East Jerusalem; recognises this within a broader context of the Israeli government&#8217;s efforts to demographically alter the population of Jerusalem, and the controversial use of Israel&#8217;s Absentee Property Law to dispossess Palestinians of their land; notes the Sumarin family have lived at their property, with deeds of ownership, for over fifty years; reiterates that ethnic cleansing is one of the most serious crimes, and that the UK is committed to upholding international law; urgently requests the Government to intervene on behalf of the Sumarin family, and calls on the Charity Commission to review the charitable status of JNF UK.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Drew Hendry</span></p>
			<p>This House welcomes the three-month suspension of debts and overpayments being deducted from universal credit; notes that sums to repay advance payments continue to be deducted from universal credit, and that such deductions are a main driver of need for food banks; notes also that the continuation of deductions will eliminate much of the effect on claimants' living standards of the twelve-month increase in the standard allowance; and calls on the Government to introduce with immediate effect its stated policy, which is not due to take effect until October 2021, of easing the rate of deductions from universal credit by extending the repayment period and lowering the monthly cap on deductions.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the work of Marcus Rashford and FareShare; notes their exceptional fundraising efforts that have seen thousands of meals distributed to school children who would normally be entitled to free school meals; further notes Mr Rashford's powerful letter to all Members of this House dated 15 June 2020 which highlights the 200,000 children that will have to miss a meal due to their parents not being able to access food during the covid-19 lockdown; notes with that regret that 45 per cent of BAME children now live in poverty; is concerned that school children across England are forced to go hungry with many families relying on food banks; calls on the Prime Minister to meet with Mr Rashford, representatives of FareShare and children who are entitled to free school meals as soon as possible; and urges the Government to bring forward a scheme to provide provision for children who would normally receive free school meals over the summer holidays.</p>

			<p>This this House is concerned to learn the important BBC regional programme Inside Out East  is under threat as the corporation seeks to make cuts to programming; understands that regional segments of Politics East are similarly threatened; regrets that all filming of these award-winning BBC regional current affairs programmes has been postponed and the programmes look likely to be shelved following an internal review expected by the end of June 2020; notes that Inside Out is a unique programme, rooted in the heart of our communities, investigating and holding those in power to account and telling remarkable stories of life across the region; further notes that that programme has helped to bring issues of public concern to national attention, serving a valuable function in the democratic life at local authority and constituency-wide level; and supports the call of the National Union of Journalists for the BBC to rethink the proposals to cut those vital, local current affairs programmes.</p>
