			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the &#8216;no recourse to public funds&#8217; restrictions placed on many forms of leave to remain in the UK are a source of significant financial hardship; appreciates that a great many people have been living, working and contributing economically, socially and culturally to life in the UK while being excluded from accessing any public funds; is concerned that these restrictions, which can be a cause of hardship at the best of times, are pushing people and families into destitution during the coronavirus crisis; acknowledges that people from all backgrounds have found their livelihoods and incomes under threat due to the coronavirus and not all of those affected have been able to access financial assistance through Government coronavirus support schemes; understands that this situation is particularly desperate for those subject to no recourse to public funds restrictions as they are also excluded from the social safety which would provide support such as housing benefit or universal credit; further recognises the work of the Kurdish Development Association, and in particular Shakha Sattar, for their work in highlighting these issues and campaigning for change; believes that it is essential everyone has access to a social safety net as a basic human right; and calls on the UK Government to immediately lift the &#8216;no recourse to public funds&#8217; restrictions and ensure that everyone who needs support can access it during this crisis and the recovery that follows.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John Nicolson</p>
			<p>That this House calls for the teaching of British colonial history in school curricula across the UK; recognises that much of Britain's wealth was built upon brutal suppression and the embedding of racism and division across the world; that great cities such as Glasgow, Liverpool and Bristol were built upon the investments of the slave trade; that our collective lack of understanding of Britain's role in cultivating notions of race and racial hierarchy misinforms discussions about racism in Britain to this day; and notes that unpicking how and why racial prejudice was constructed would make for a more sophisticated discussion about racism now and would erode the false notion that Britain was ever exclusively &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>

			<p>That this House notes United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres&#8217; recent call for a global ceasefire to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19; futher notes that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab endorsed this call for peace; is concerned that little action has been taken by the UK government to make this a reality; laments the fact that there are currently thousands of British forces in at least 35 countries around the world, including 1,000 in Afghanistan and more than 1,000 in the Middle East including in Iraq and Saudi Arabia; is appalled that Britain remains complicit in the Saudi-led coalition&#8217;s war in Yemen; recognises that the coronavirus outbreak offers our government a unique opportunity to step away from global conflicts; and calls on the Government to immediately draw up a plan to withdraw British troops from war zones.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jim Shannon</span><span class="signatory">Richard Burgon</span></p>
			<p>That this House condemns the continued practice of gay and transgender conversion therapies in the UK; notes that this practice has been linked to an increased risk of suicide, poor mental health and substance abuse; recognises that the Government has pledged to ban such practices in their LGBT Action Plan 2018 but has yet to bring forward those plans; further notes that many other jurisdictions have banned this abhorrent practice including most recently Germany; and calls on the Government to expedite plans to introduce a ban on conversion therapies in order to protect the UK's LGBT+ Community.</p>

			<p>That this House notes many students in further and higher education experience financial hardship during the course of their studies and that these difficulties are being exacerbated by the wider economic and social consequences of the coronavirus pandemic; further notes that financial support provided by awards agencies and student loan companies across different parts of the UK is usually provided on a term-time basis only, and that many students would seek to supplement their income with paid employment, especially during summer months; believes that many traditional summer job opportunities for students are unlikely to exist as a result of social distancing and economic restrictions; and urges all Governments across the UK  to work in partnership with each other, student representative bodies and relevant awards agencies and loans companies to ensure that adequate financial support is available to further and higher education students throughout the 2020 calendar year, including access to universal credit or other appropriate benefits, the provision of increased finance to further and higher education institutions to disburse through hardship funds, and access to other appropriate support during these unprecedented times.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that 8 June 2020 marks the eighth anniversary of the UK Government signing the Istanbul Convention on the protection of women and girls from violence; welcomes the Convention&#8217;s ratification by 33 of the original signatories including the UK's friends and neighbours in Ireland; recognises the work done by Eilidh Whiteford, formerly member for the Banff and Buchan constituency in bringing forward the Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Ratification of Convention) Act 2017; expresses disappointment in the UK Government not having ratified the Convention in the three years since the Act received Royal Assent; and calls on the UK Government to finally ratify this vital international agreement that will help protect women and girls here and across Europe.</p>
