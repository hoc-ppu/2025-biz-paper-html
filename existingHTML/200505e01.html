			<p class="MotionSponsor">Apsana Begum</p>
			<p>That this House notes the Child Poverty Action Group and the Church of England&#8217;s report, published 5 May 2020, which found that an estimated 60,000 families will be affected by the two-child limit as a result of the covid-19 crisis, joining around 230,000 families affected by the policy since April 2017; is alarmed that as parents get ill, lose their job, or experience a fall in their income as a result of the coronavirus, a growing number of families are discovering that the safety net that should be provided by the social security system is not adequate to meet their needs; and calls on the Government to abolish the two-child limit and ensure that people get the support they need, when they need it, as a part of a comprehensive strategy to tackle poverty in all its forms.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jamie Stone</p>
			<p>That this House commends Clydesdale Bank for cancelling all planned branch closures until further notice; notes that TSB bank has ignored attempts to discuss, and is committed to, continuing with closing its branch in Tain; acknowledges that bank branches are indispensable in cash-based economies; further acknowledges that branch closures will cut off communities from accessing cash; further notes that the Government&#8217;s suggested solution to use online banking is inappropriate due to poor broadband infrastructure in the Highlands; calls on the Government to intervene and prevent TSB and other Banks to cancel branch closures until further notice.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	5/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p>That this House condemns the emerging trend of criminals seeking to exploit coronavirus with a new range of scams; welcomes the free scam alerts set up by Which?; urges people to forward any suspicious emails to the National Cyber Security Centre, and to highlight any online scams of which they become aware to the authorities so they can be removed; is concerned that scammers are using any means available, including emails, text messages, phone calls and even doorstep visits to perpetrate fraud; understands that scammers are taking advantage of the fact we are increasingly interacting online, with the UK&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre taking down more than 2,000 online coronavirus scams last month, including 471 fake online shops, 555 malicious content websites and&#160;200 phishing sites seeking to obtain personal information such as passwords and card details; recognises some common scams have recently developed including the selling of fake coronavirus tests, fake vaccines and cures, bogus messages from HMRC regarding tax refunds and even demands that people pay fines for breaking lockdown rules; acknowledges that scam emails and other correspondence purporting to be from legitimate sources are often sophisticated and appear completely authentic; understands that people are safer if they only buy from trusted and legitimate retailers, and are extremely vigilant regarding any unsolicited contact at this time; and affirms that much like the coronavirus pandemic, it is only by coming together to protect one another that ruthless criminals seeking to profit from this health crisis will be defeated.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">445</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Contribution of civil service employees during covid-19 crisis</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	5/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p>That this House expresses its gratitude to the tens of thousands of workers across the civil service who are playing absolutely critical frontline roles at this time of the covid-19 epidemic; praises their dedication and professionalism at this testing time; notes that Department for Work Pensions' staff are coping with an unprecedented spike in claims for universal credit; further notes that HMRC workers are processing applications to the Job Retention Scheme vital to protecting jobs and livelihoods; regrets that these members have seen a prolonged pay squeeze in real terms since the onset of austerity following the financial crisis, and that many are now understandably worried about their own financial circumstances; believe that it is in everyone&#8217;s interest to allow the civil service workers to dedicate all of their attention to coming to grips with the present crisis, rather than having to engage with the highly fragmented series of pay bargaining processes across the civil service; commends the civil service union PCS for putting forward constructive proposals for an interim agreement for the duration of the crisis based on an above-inflation pay settlement; welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to enter into such agreement; and therefore calls on the UK Government to follow suit in reaching an agreement over pay, and also to implement a moratorium on redundancies and office closures.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">446</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Coronavirus support groups in Perth and North Perthshire</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Pete Wishart</p>
			<p>That this House commends the invaluable contributions made by voluntary groups, businesses and individuals who have given their time and effort to co-ordinate support for the most vulnerable in Perth and North Perthshire; acknowledges the community spirit shown by those making individual sacrifices at this difficult time to ensure that everyone has access to essential food shopping, prescriptions and support to reduce the negative effects of social isolation; notes, amongst many others, the efforts undertaken by Feldy-Roo in Aberfeldy, who have now delivered over 10,000 free meals to those most vulnerable in Aberfeldy and the surrounding villages; pays tribute to the work that is being done by organisations such as PKAVS, Letham Community Fridge, Pitlochry Community Helpline and Blairgowrie and Rattray Coronavirus Co-ordination Group, amongst many others across the constituency; and finally commends the efforts of everyone across the constituency for showing community spirit, care and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>

			<p>That this House is extremely concerned that the world&#8217;s worst man-made humanitarian crisis could deteriorate further following reports of imminent aid cuts to UN humanitarian programmes in Yemen; notes that more than five years of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi armed group has already resulted in two-thirds of the population being on the brink of starvation and a broken healthcare system; is dismayed that, despite the announcement of a short unilateral ceasefire by the Saudi-led coalition, to help Yemen focus on containing the spread of the coronavirus, fighting has continued, including in the governorates of Marib, al-Jawf, Hajja, Al-Bayda, Sa&#8217;ada, Sana&#8217;a and Al-Hodeidah; urges all warring parties in Yemen not to exploit the pandemic for military and political gain, and to prioritise the welfare of the Yemeni people; and calls on the Government to work with the UN and the wider international community to back efforts to secure a long-lasting ceasefire, restart peace negotiations, and provide essential humanitarian supplies to all those in need.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises there are loopholes in the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme for new starters; acknowledges that the support offered of 80 per cent of wages up to &#163;2,500 a month is vital for workers during the coronavirus outbreak; recognises that the cut-off date of 19 March 2020 for an employer to submit an RTI notification to HMRC means in practice that people who started jobs in March are exempt from the furlough scheme; believes the Government&#8217;s proposed solution for those missed by the scheme to be re-hired by previous employers is inadequate because tight guidelines for furloughing former staff do not fit all circumstances and past employers have no legal requirement to re-hire staff; understands the lack of support offered to new starters means many households are being pushed into debt and destitution; recognises the Government&#8217;s aim to combat fraudulent claims through use of a cut-off date, but suggests other methods of doing so, such as submission of employment contracts; notes the strength of feeling among those missed by the scheme who are taking part in the #newstarterfurlough campaigns on social media; and urges the Chancellor to close the loopholes and extend the furlough scheme to new starters.</p>

			<p>This House notes the increase in use of artificial intelligence and automated-decision-making to recruit, manage and pay workers remotely through the coronavirus pandemic; recognises that learning from past patterns of behaviour to inform decisions about the future increases the risk of deepening inequality for people and groups who are already experiencing disadvantage; further notes that fair access to, and terms of, work is critical at a time when 15 per cent of the workforce have already lost their jobs and over 2 million people are claiming universal credit; expresses concern that the auditing tools most commonly used to assess the risk of discrimination are importing legal standards from the United States which do not reflect the purpose or requirements of the Equality Act 2010; recognises new research from the Institute for the Future of Work which reveals significant limitations in exiting approaches to assessing the impacts of automated systems on equality; and calls on the Government to develop and enforce high industry standards to promote good governance and compliance of the Equality Act, to require regular Equality Impact Assessments as proposed by the Institute for the Future of Work and to review the application and enforcement of the Equality Act to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>

			<p>That this Parliament calls on British Airways and other airlines to not use the covid-19 outbreak as an opportunity to reduce jobs and employees' terms and conditions; asks them instead to explore all the funding options available to maintain the sustainability of jobs as part of an overall plan for business recovery once the current public health crisis is brought under control; calls on them to work with the Government to extend the duration of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme as a way of avoiding mass redundancies; and calls on the Government to accede to such a request.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that British Airways has made 12,000 staff redundant; thanks these workers for their heroic efforts in repatriating those stranded due to covid-19 at their own risk; offers solidarity to these workers that find themselves needlessly out of a job in the middle of a global pandemic; is disappointed that British Airways chose to take the decision to reject Government support and announce it on International Workers&#8217; Memorial Day; emphasises that, as an island, aviation is essential to the UK for trade, business and managing social and family networks; looks to the governments of our European neighbours who are taking action to protect their aviation industries; urges the Government to provide fully-repayable loans and take a financial stake in aviation companies; asks aviation companies to cap all elements of executive pay, protect employee terms and conditions and transition to greener, more efficient travel operations once flights resume; and calls on the Government to publicly finance smaller airports, air traffic control and specific routes within the UK aviation network to retain much-needed vital connectivity.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the crisis facing the oil and gas sector as a result of covid-19; notes that the price of oil is now just over $20 per barrel compared with over $70 per barrel this time last year; fears that this low price of oil could see upwards of 3,500 workers displaced by September 2020; expresses solidarity with drilling sector workers who have been told there will not be any upturn in activity until 2022; is distressed to hear Subsea sector contracts are being ended and vessels tied up; notes the effect that this will have on Government energy strategy and the wider economy; and calls on the Government to intervene to save the sector, protect jobs and ensure a just transition to a carbon neutral state.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the updated Construction Leadership Council guidance version three is considerably weaker than version two; is particularly troubled by the relaxation of measures relating to social distancing; is worried about the implications of this on the health and safety of construction workers and the wider public; urges contractors and clients to enforce on site social distancing; further urges contractors and clients to prove they are taking their moral duty to construction workers seriously by staggering site opening times to allow workers to social distance by avoiding overcrowded public transport; understands the importance of key workers not only feeling safe in the workplace but from when they leave their home to start work to when they return home after finishing work; and supports the withdrawal of the Construction Leadership Council guidance and the implementation of tougher procedures, which are strictly enforced.</p>
