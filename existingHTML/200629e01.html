			<p>That this House encourages employers to maintain flexible working beyond the end of covid-19 lockdown restrictions; understands that many companies have switched to allowing home and flexible working to continue their operations throughout the public health crisis; notes that not only is flexible working is beneficial to employees that have caring responsibilities and can therefore assist in tackling the gender-pay gap, but can also increase productivity in the workplace; believes that all jobs should be open to flexible working unless an employer can demonstrate an immediate and continuing business case against doing so; and calls on the Government to work with businesses to ensure that flexible working becomes the new normal after the covid-19 outbreak.</p>
