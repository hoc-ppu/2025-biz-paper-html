			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	16/01/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Law</p>
			<p>That this House strongly condemns the Government of Bahrain&#8217;s increased use of capital punishment, including the recent re-imposition of death sentences against dissidents, Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa; is concerned that that their sentences were based heavily on confessions extracted under torture and that the prosecution failed to present any physical or forensic evidence; that the defendants&#8217; allegations of torture were corroborated by a medical report; expresses further concern about the Foreign Office&#8217;s failure to acknowledge evidence of torture and due process violations despite British diplomats monitoring the trial; is aware that there are twelve political prisoners on death row in Bahrain, of whom eight are at risk of imminent execution, having exhausted all legal remedies; that a further twelve individuals are sentenced to death on non-political charges; joins the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions in deeming the execution of five political prisoners in Bahrain since January 2017 to be arbitrary killings, including those of Ali Al-Arab and Ahmed Al-Malali in July 2019; raises concerns about the failure of British taxpayer funding to strengthen the rule of law in Bahrain; reminds the UK Government of their commitment to abolish the death penalty globally, especially given the UK&#8217;s prolonged involvement in Bahrain&#8217;s &#8220;justice reform&#8221;; calls upon the UK government to condemn the torture of Ramadhan and Moosa and their deeply unfair trial and to suspend its training to bodies accused of human rights violations pending an evaluation of evidence of genuine reform.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p>That this House joins the Mayor of North Tyneside, the Council, and the Police in warmly congratulating the staff of the Anson pub in Wallsend for immediately offering shelter and comfort 100 local people who were forced to leave their homes this month at 2am following blasts and a major fire at a nearby tyre yard and workshop; agrees with Mayor Norma Redfern that people in Wallsend are really the salt of the Earth; and believes that such civic mindedness is a tribute to the strength of the local community of which North Tyneside and the whole country can be immensely proud.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates rugby league fans throughout the UK and beyond for their support of Rob Burrow after his recent diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease; recognises the support of playing colleague Jamie Jones-Buchanan for his incredible gesture in sharing his testimonial game with Rob and family; recognises the role of Leeds Rhinos and Bradford Bulls in creating a superb occasion fit for the event; applauds Sky Sports, particularly former executive Neville Smith for broadcasting the game without production fee; salutes the fans who attended the game and selling out the Emerald Headingley Stadium and creating an amazing atmosphere; and wishes Rob, wife Lindsey and their children Macy, Maya and Jackson all the very best during this difficult time.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">71</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>End the outsourcing of TfL Underground and Overground cleaners</h3>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Ian Byrne</span><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House pays tribute to cleaners employed on London Underground and Overground who keep the capital's transport network clear of obstructions, and maintain it in a hygienic state while working unsocial hours in dirty and hazardous conditions; notes that Transport for London continues to use outsourcing companies ABM and Vinci to employ cleaners on London Underground and the Overground rail network; notes with concern that a recent RMT survey of ABM cleaners revealed that the overwhelming majority struggle to make ends meet on low pay, have far worse working conditions than directly employed staff and believe that ABM puts profits ahead of passenger and staff concerns; further notes that the overwhelming majority of cleaners want to be directly employed and brought in-house and believe that bringing all cleaning staff on London's Underground and Overground network in-house will help improve working conditions for this vulnerable group of workers, improve the quality of service for passengers and represent greater economy and efficiency; and urges the London Mayor to commit to bringing these workers in-house and to convene a working group with the RMT union and other stakeholders to discuss how this can be achieved.</p>

			<p>That this House notes this Government could be responsible for five of the remaining 11 years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned are left to halve global emissions and limit warming to 1.5C; further notes that the Committee on Climate Change report in July 2019 revealed the Government had delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to get on track to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets than net zero by 2050, and that the UK's climate credibility rested on decisive Government action over thesubsequent 18 months; considers therefore that this Parliament will be regarded as the Climate Parliament and must seize this opportunity to ensure adequate action is taken to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown; welcomes the fact that the UK will host the UN climate summit COP26 in December 2020; considers success at this summit means recognising the moral imperative of doing everything possible to keep temperature rise to 1.5C, and the vast human cost to people around the world, including the UK, from extreme weather, food insecurity, sea level rise, and other events exacerbated by the climate crisis; urges the Government therefore to make addressing the climate emergency the central priority for domestic policy-making across all departments and on the global stage; and calls on the Government to enact a comprehensive Green New Deal, including the release of necessary funding to allow local authorities to lead, to rapidly decarbonise the entire UK economy while creating a fair and just society.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the proposal and specification issued in September 2015 for the national holocaust memorial and learning centre; regrets that subsequent proposals and methods of propagation fail to meet the specifications; regrets that the management of the proposals fails to meet expected standards of openness, process and environmental requirements; and calls on ministers to meet leading objectors to find a sensible appropriate way forward, considering appropriate designs and locations.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mike Hill</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that veterans are an asset to our society and deserve the best possible care and support; considers that those who have been injured in the service of the UK deserve the full value of their War Disablement Pension; notes that under the current system the War Disablement Pension is counted as income by the Department of Work and Pensions and can therefore lead to veterans being materially disadvantaged when claiming Employment Support Allowance; welcomes the Scottish Government's alteration of the rules to ensure that the War Disablement Pension is exempt from income assessments and that veterans therefore receive its full value; and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to follow suit and disregard the War Disablement Pension from means-testing.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">12</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Charity lotteries reform</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Drew Hendry</span><span class="signatory">Mary Glindon</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the Government's decision in July 2019 - following significant and lengthy research and consultation - to raise the charity lottery annual sales limit to &#163;50 million, thus reducing burdensome bureaucracy and administration costs whilst allowing millions of pounds more in funding to be directed to charities across the country; notes that the Government has not yet implemented the new limit; further notes that the official regulator, The Gambling Commission, has backed early implementation of the new limit; and calls on the Government to implement the new limit in the first quarter of 2020 at the latest, in order to avoid further delay that would mean local charities across the country losing out on more vital funding.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">13</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>IR35 review and off-payroll tax roll-out to private sector</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	19/12/19	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	20</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Tim Farron</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mary Glindon</span><span class="signatory">Alan Brown</span><span class="signatory">Steven Bonnar</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the previous Government&#8217;s plans to extend the off-payroll (IR35) changes to the private sector, despite the damage that this has done to the public sector including the NHS; further notes that the off-payroll tax means a 14.3 per cent extra cost on UK business made up of National Insurance and the Apprenticeship Levy; believes that this will damage the UK&#8217;s flexible workforce and the UK economy, driving up project costs and depriving businesses of access to key skills; notes that firms are already laying off self-employed contractors and that others are looking to offshore resource to avoid the extra costs; further notes that HMRC estimate that 153,000 UK contractors could lose up 25 per cent of their pay and that thousands of contractors will be asked to pay their clients employment tax bills, without getting the benefits of employment such as sick and holiday pay and a pension contribution; is concerned that the off-payroll tax will lead to tax non-compliance and the danger of people being lured into avoidance schemes, as happened with those now facing the loan charge; welcomes the commitment made by the Chancellor to hold an IR35 review made during the election, but believes this is will only be a genuine review if the roll-out is halted; and therefore calls for an immediate halt to the off-payroll tax roll-out and announcement of an independent review looking into how best to recognise contracting and freelancing in the tax system..</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Mary Glindon</span><span class="signatory">Mike Hill</span><span class="signatory">Margaret Ferrier</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the importance of the music industry to our economy and the work, talent and expertise of musicians from all four nations of the United Kingdom; acknowledges that musicians rely on touring and performing in the other 27 nations of the European Union to make a living; appreciates that touring can mean visits to multiple countries, often crossing borders on a daily basis with very little notice; supports calls for visa and customs rules post-Brexit that account for this unique of working; expresses support for, and solidarity with, the Musicians&#8217; Union and its members; and pledges support for an EU- wide live music touring passport that will last a minimum of two years, is free or at least affordable, covers all member states of the European Union, annuls the need for carnets and other permits and covers road crew and technicians.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mary Glindon</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the substantial contribution of Hartlepool nuclear power station to our national grid; considers that this important institution is set to be decommissioned by 2024; recognises that with growing energy needs, this power station must be replaced to meet its current 5 per cent contribution; acknowledges the importance of Hartlepool nuclear power station as a major employer in Teesside; and calls on the Secretary of State for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to announce its intentions for the future of the site.</p>

			<p>That this House affirms its commitment to the Global Goals for Sustainable Development agreed by Member States of the United Nations in 2015 with the aim of ending poverty, fighting inequality and addressing the urgency of climate change by 2030;  believes the United Kingdom&#8217;s statutory commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income each year as Official Development Assistance demonstrates cross-party consensus in the UK behind the importance of those goals, and ambitious leadership among the international community of donor countries; further believes that the existence since 1997 of a dedicated Government Department and Secretary of State for International Development has protected and enhanced the work of Government and thousands of agencies and charities funded by Government, in meeting global targets to end poverty; and believes that the Department for International Development should continue to exist as a dedicated Government Department throughout the lifetime of this Parliament and beyond.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the number of people living in blocks with  cladding (both ACM and HPL) which has either been identified as unsafe or has yet to be inspected; is aware that a growing number of people are currently unable to sell their homes because of this problem; believes that these leaseholders should not have to pay for the cost of inspecting and/or replacing this cladding or for waking watches to enable them to stay in their homes; and calls on the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government to set out urgently what steps he intends to take to deal with the current situation which is causing great concern to thousands of people.  </p>

			<p>That this House notes that in 1998 members of the Foreign Affairs, Trade, Defence and International Development Committees met together to scrutinise the Government's annual report on arms exports; further notes that this arrangement has been repeated annually and gradually became more formalised as the Committees on Arms Exports Controls (CAEC); expresses concern that, at a time when arms exports were an issue of major public interest, the CAEC in the last Parliament, as technically comprising four separate Committees, found it difficult to hold a quorate meeting; and calls for the establishment of a Committee on Arms Export Controls as a full non-departmental Select Committee, as was one of the recommendations from the 2017-19 CAEC, with an elected chair, members dedicated to it and adequate staffing so as to enable it to give effective scrutiny to a major cross-departmental issue.</p>

			<p>That this House supports Young Carers Awareness Day, led by Carers Trust, which takes place on 30 January 2020; recognises the importance of young carers, who include as many as 1 in 5 children and young people in the UK; highlights the challenges faced by young carers and the negative impact their caring responsibilities can have on their education; acknowledges that research shows that young carers perform substantially less well than their peers at school; notes that compulsory education providers have an important role in identifying and supporting young carers; and calls on the Government to collect and publish information about the attendance, school achievement and well-being of young carers.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the 77 per cent increase in the number of homeless families in temporary accommodation in England to 84,740 since 2010, including 126,020 children, with a further 82,000 children sofa surfing according to the Children&#8217;s Commissioner; is concerned that according to Crisis a further 3.74 million people would rather have a home of their own; condemns the increasing number of homeless individuals dying, including 726 in 2018 alone; recognises that a large proportion of homelessness is the result of cuts to housing benefit; notes that the increase in evictions is driven by insecure tenancies and exacerbated by court action, that temporary accommodation for some is lasting over ten years, and that the impact on the health and well-being of homeless people and their children can be very severe; and calls on the Government to support the Elimination of Homelessness Bill, urgently take steps to increase housing and council tax benefit as well as universal credit, and adequately fund local authorities to ensure that no property remains empty or unused for more than six months.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the growing body of evidence, including research reports by Doctors of the World, Maternity Action and the British Medical Association, that the NHS England overseas visitors charging regime is deterring vulnerable migrant women living in the UK from seeking essential maternity care; is further concerned that the MBRRACE-UK report, Saving Lives, Improving Mothers&#8217; Care 2019, published on 13 December 2019, links the charging regime and a possible fear of being charged to the deaths of three women who delayed seeking critical antenatal care in 2015-17; notes that the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Public Health, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Midwives have all urged ministers to suspend the charging regime pending a full independent review of its impact on individual and public health; further notes that less than 40 per cent of the total sum of charges levied in England in recent years has actually been recovered by the NHS; agrees with the stated view of the Royal College of Midwives that the Government has a duty to give the NHS the resources it needs and should not be using NHS clinicians to patrol our borders; and urges the Government to respond positively to Maternity Action&#8217;s call, supported by the Royal College of Midwives, for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the publication of the Online Harms White Paper in April 2019 and subsequent assurances by the Government that they will introduce a robust regulator to safeguard children online; further notes that over 45,000 people signed the NSPCC&#8217;s Wild West Web petition calling for statutory regulation so that social networks have a legal duty of care to protect every child from abuse online; and notes the urgent need for Government action as data obtained by the NSPCC shows that over the last year an average of 11 child sexual offences occurred each day over just three commonly-used social network platforms; notes that the Home Office estimates that 80,000 adults in the UK poses a sexual threat to children online; recognises that due to the pressing need for change and the time it would take to set up a new regulator that an interim regulator should be appointed to fill the regulatory gap while more long-term measures are being put in place; and calls on the Government to bring in legislation as promised to assign a duty of care regulator to keep children safe online as a matter of urgency, and, in the interim, to support Lord McNally's Private Member's Bill, introduced on 14 January 2020 into the House of Lords, which instructs Ofcom to start preparing for the new regime.</p>
