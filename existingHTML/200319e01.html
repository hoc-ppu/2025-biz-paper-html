			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Paul Girvan</span><span class="signatory">Carla Lockhart</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the serious impact of the downturn in economic activity due to the steps taken to deal with the covid-19 virus and its consequences, in particular the self-employed and freelance workers; and calls on the Government to use emergency legislation to introduce a temporary basic income aimed at supporting people who are self-employed, freelance or independent and who may not otherwise be covered by the employment support package which the Government has promised to introduce to help people through this crisis.</p>
			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Kenny MacAskill</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">John Cryer</span></p>
			<p>That this House believes that the universal credit benefit system continues to have a disproportionately harmful effect on tenants in social housing; is concerned that universal credit&#8217;s five week waiting period has forced social housing tenants who rely on this lifeline benefit into arrears and poverty; notes that research from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations showed that nearly 65 per cent of social housing tenants claiming universal credit are in arrears, compared to 32 per cent of all other tenants; supports the aims of the Living Rent Charter which calls for an end to evictions arising from the design of universal credit; welcomes the support of the social landlords who sign up to the charter, agreeing to abstain from carrying out evictions due to arrears; and calls on housing associations across Scotland, and the rest of the UK, to consider signing up to a similar promise of ending evictions for claimants in arrears on universal credit.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Gavin Robinson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">John Cryer</span></p>
			<p>That this House commemorates for International Women&#8217;s Day the Matchgirls who went on strike in 1888 at the Bryant and May factory in Bow in response to poor working conditions; notes that factory workers were expected to work 14 hour days for poor pay in an unsafe working environment due to the exposure of phosphorus which was used to make matches; commends their achievements of scrapping the factory&#8217;s fine system, setting up a grievance system, abolishing the deductions for working materials and the improvement of health and safety standards; further notes the continued need to advocate for high labour standards; and recognises the Matchgirls as pioneers of gender equality and fairness at work who through their strike action and formation of the Union of Women Match Makers left a lasting legacy on the trade union movement.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates International Women's Day which took place on Sunday March 8; recognises the importance of marking the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women; reaffirms its commitment to promoting gender equality; notes with sadness that the subjugation and persecution of women and girls remains a global phenomenon; laments the fact that many women in the world are persecuted for both their gender and their faith, such as Yazidi women in Iraq or Hindu and Christian girls forcibly converted and married in Pakistan; believes that the UK government can play an important role in addressing the specific vulnerabilities experienced by women from religious minority communities around the world; calls on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development to recognise these specific vulnerabilities; and urges the UK Government to include targeted programming and aid for women who face double vulnerabilities as members of minority faith communities, include religion as a factor of vulnerability in any assessment made in planning and programming and ensure that sensitivity relating to the international right to freedom of religion or belief is integrated into gender-related and anti-discrimination programmes.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">280</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>War widows pensions</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	11/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	43</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House honours and recognises the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make; notes the particular sacrifices that the partners of veterans make and the consequences for them of tragically losing a spouse or partner serving in the armed forces; notes the changes announced in 2014 which allowed war widows or widowers that lost their spouse or cohabiting partner in service in the armed forces before 6 April 2005, and had not remarried by 1 April 2015, to retain their war widow pension for life regardless of ongoing relationship status; notes however that this regrettably excluded war widows bereaved before 6 April 2005 that had already had to surrender their war widows pension upon remarrying or cohabiting; believes that this is unacceptable; notes that the only way this group of war widows could regain their pensions is by divorcing their current partners and remarrying them; agrees with the then Defence Secretary who said on 18 February 2019 that this was a burning injustice, Official Report, column 1187; and therefore supports the campaign of the War Widows Association to rectify this anomaly; and urges the Government to correct this injustice by providing equalisation and compensation for the small number of war widows unjustly affected.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Patricia Gibson</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Wendy Chamberlain</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement to allow employed parents of premature and sick babies to to claim up to 12 weeks Neonatal Leave and Pay; recognises the positive impact this will have for thousands of families every year; understands that over 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care every year leading to many parents using their maternity or paternity leave before getting them home; notes around 1 in 4 working men do not currently qualify for paternity leave; understands that this limits parental involvement in their baby's care despite this being essential for babies&#8217; to have the best developmental outcomes; notes having a baby in neonatal care has been shown to negatively affect parents&#8217; mental health with some studies reporting up to 40 per cent of mothers of preterm babies showing signs of post-natal depression compared to 10 per cent of mothers generally; further notes that neonatal care is expensive with parents reporting additional costs of over &#163;280 for every week their baby is in neonatal care at a time when their household income is reduced; and calls on the Government to introduce these welcome proposals swiftly with consideration for parents who do not currently qualify for parental leave rights due to being self-employed or a worker.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Drew Hendry</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Alison Thewliss</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House acknowledges that over 2,000 EU citizens living in Midlothian have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living and working in the UK; recognises the enormous contribution that EU citizens make to the cultural and economic fabric of the UK every day; further recognises Scotland&#8217;s particular reliance on EU citizens, with 26 per cent of small employers in Scotland having at least one EU citizen on the team compared to 21 per cent across the UK; notes with concern the risk that treating settlement in the UK as a privilege rather than a right could have on small businesses in Midlothian as a hub for small business; condemns the EU Settlement Scheme for treating settlement in the UK not as a right but a privilege; further condemns the Home Office for its lack of clarity in providing details of how many EU citizens have been granted settled status and pre-settled status; and recognises that the incompatibility between the Home Office&#8217;s approach to EU citizens and the needs of Scotland further underlines the need for Scotland to pursue an independent future with a more compassionate, open migration system.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the work of Glasgow Afghan United (GAU), a community-led organisation in North of Glasgow that seeks to improve the lives of Afghan people and a wide range of ethnic minority communities in the city by promoting sport, health &amp; well-being, social integration and active citizenship; congratulates GAU on its wide range of community work, including its women&#8217;s empowerment programme, educational classes for families, community and sports programmes for all ages; notes that GAU also run a number of successful community events celebrating occasions such as Afghan New Year as well as their highly popular annual refugee football tournament, which has attracted participants of over 50 nationalities and from a range of local charities and civic bodies; further notes the success of their recent multicultural Burns supper, held in Glasgow City Chambers, which celebrated the works of Robert Burns and renowned Afghan poet, Rumi, and which brought together members of the Afghan community along with many of the other diverse communities that make up Glasgow; further congratulates GAU on the deserved recognition it received by winning the Building Inclusive Communities category at the recent Herald and GenAnalytics Diversity Awards; commends GAU&#8217;s president Abdul Bostani who has recently been nominated as the Sports Person and Volunteer of the Year at the Glasgow Times awards for his hard work in the community; and wishes GAU every success for the future.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Chris Stephens</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern that each year, thousands of animals including monkeys, mice, pigs and guinea pigs are experimented on using chemical, biological and other weapons, causing prolonged and extensive suffering; notes that while these experiments are not conducted to develop or test offensive weapons, suffering can continue for hours until the animal dies or is killed; further notes that examples of the symptoms of warfare experiments include bleeding genitals, writhing, substantial incapacitation, gasping, continuous tremor and visible production of saliva; highlights that the suffering is in addition to the standard deprivations of life in a laboratory that include restrictions on movement, inability to choose cage-mates and stress induced by human presence, light and sound; further notes that in 2018 at Porton Down, 1,941 animals were experimented upon for warfare experiments and that 30.2 per cent of those experiments  were classified as severe which resulted in the highest level of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm; and calls on the Government to introduce a ban on the use of live animals for warfare experiments.</p>

			<p>That this House urges the UK Government to immediately request an extension to the transition period and to suspend negotiations with the EU until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to 1 or 2 years; believes that public health professionals&#8217; advice for self-isolation will inevitably reduce the capacity of the Civil Service to negotiate a future agreement as well as its ability to replace European frameworks and agencies; recalls that the Prime Minister said in a statement on 12 March that there will be severe disruption across our country for many months; calls on the Government to minimise uncertainty for people and businesses during the outbreak; and further calls on the UK Government to work closely with other European governments in responding to the pandemic.</p>

			<p>That this House marks the 32nd anniversary of one of the worst incidents of mass murder by chemical weapons when the town of Halabja in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq was attacked by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s war planes on 16 March 1988; notes that the use of chemical weapons caused agonising death, often in minutes, of 5,000 men, women and children as well as injuring over 10,000 and in many cases inflicting life-long and debilitating illnesses; further notes that the attack on Halabja was accompanied by a wider campaign of genocide known as the Anfal in which about 180,000 Kurds were murdered and thousands of villages razed to the ground in an act of destruction with continuing harm to the agricultural bedrock of the Kurdistan Region; applauds the decision in February 2013 of the UK parliament to formally recognise the Anfal genocide and the decision of the UK government to mark Anfal each year; believes that remembrance is vital not only to mark the memories of those who were murdered, many of whom have yet to be unearthed from so far hidden mass graves, but also to challenge the mentality in parts of Iraq towards the equality of the Kurds; and expresses its full solidarity with the Kurds in Iraq as they seek to overcome their tragic history and forge pluralism and prosperity in a pan-Iraqi context while being key allies in the continuing fight against extremism and bigotry.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the publication of Sir Amyas Morse&#8217;s Loan Charge review and the announcement that the Government will make some amendments to the relevant legislation; notes that loans made before 2010 will no longer be subject to the Loan Charge and that the self-assessment deadline has been delayed until 30 September 2020; believes that people should pay the tax that they owe, but that HMRC failed to work constructively with those seeking a Loan Charge repayment plan, with concerns that some may face bankruptcy or homelessness; demands HMRC review the implementation of this policy to ensure that nobody seeking to make repayment is treated unfairly with undeliverable financial demands; condemns the tax professionals who advised clients to use such loopholes given the importance of people paying their fair share for public services; and urges the Government to pursue the organisations that facilitated these loans.</p>

			<p>That this House expresses concern that the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardising the work and income as well as the health of many people, including the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts; notes that the Government&#8217;s revised sick pay policy announced in the budget does not expand eligibility for statutory sick pay, and that an estimated 2 million workers would remain excluded and reliant on employment and support allowance or universal credit; further notes that these arrangements and the low level of sick pay, currently just &#163;94.25 per week, will expose many workers and their families to financial hardship and uncertainty; recognises the increased risk to public health this poses as people are forced to remain in the workforce on economic grounds even when this is contrary to public health or medical advice; further recognises the findings of research by the Institute for the Future of Work, which indicates that boosting the statutory floor of protection would support social and economic resilience; calls for emergency legislation to introduce statutory sick pay for all as a contribution to dealing with the worst public health crisis in a generation; and further calls on the Government to initiate cross-departmental work on a policy framework for socially responsible, human-centred employment, including a review of basic statutory protection for the self-employed and those on zero-hours or gig-economy contracts.</p>

			<p>That this House remembers with great sadness that one year ago, on 15 March 2019, 51 people were murdered and many more had their lives changed forever by an act of extreme right terrorism in Christchurch, New Zealand; welcomes the report The Impact of Christchurch Terror Attack by TellMAMA, a national project which records and measures anti-Muslim incidents in the UK; notes that this extremely important and harrowing analysis of the events in Christchurch highlights that the attacks on the mosques in Christchurch had a significant effect in the UK, resulting in a rapid but long-lasting rise in anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia; recognises that the report makes challenging reading for the social media platforms who must now direct their immense resources towards ensuring the removal of unacceptable material from their sites and increased efforts to stop groups from promoting hatred and violence; further recognises that it shouldn't take a tragedy such as the events in Christchurch for society to notice how entrenched racism and islamophobia have become in society and that copycat attacks in the UK and elsewhere across the globe must be a wake-up call for all those committed to fighting hatred.</p>
