			<p>That this House congratulates Stress Control for the help that organisation has given to people suffering from depression and anxiety since the 1980s; notes that classes of up to 300 people are common, showing the popularity of the classes; acknowledges that independent research shows it works as well as individual therapy; praises the organisation for its ability to attract more individuals from hard-to-reach groups, such as those from deprived areas, minority ethnic communities and older adults, as well as men who are often less willing to admit to mental health struggles; welcomes the fact that the organisation trains teachers to deliver early intervention courses in schools as a way to prevent potential future mental health problems; further notes that the classes are widely used in the NHS, especially in the North of England, South Wales, Ireland and Northern Ireland; recognises the use of Stress Control classes in NHS Lanarkshire, in association with Elament, where classes are available throughout the year in different locations and at different times, offering participants genuine choice and rapid access to evidence-based help; further acknowledges the importance of mental health services and the enormous help they give people; thanks Dr Jim White, Consultant Psychologist, for devising the classes, which have helped hundreds of thousands of people; and wishes the organisation and all participants of Stress Control classes every success in the future.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span><span class="signatory">Jess Phillips</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes the Child Poverty Action Group and the Church of England&#8217;s report, published 5 May 2020, which found that an estimated 60,000 families will be affected by the two-child limit as a result of the covid-19 crisis, joining around 230,000 families affected by the policy since April 2017; is alarmed that as parents get ill, lose their job, or experience a fall in their income as a result of the coronavirus, a growing number of families are discovering that the safety net that should be provided by the social security system is not adequate to meet their needs; and calls on the Government to abolish the two-child limit and ensure that people get the support they need, when they need it, as a part of a comprehensive strategy to tackle poverty in all its forms.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">448</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Government support for seafarers during the covid-19 outbreak</h3>
			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	6/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	11</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that seafarers and dockers are classed by the Government as key workers; pays tribute to the vital role they have played in keeping the UK moving and connected during the Coronavirus crisis; is concerned by the findings of the RMT trade union survey of seafarers and port workers that employers are seeking to erode terms and conditions of employment in 65 per cent of cases, whilst  33 per cent of seafarers have not been supplied with personal protective equipment and 39 per cent of maritime workers believe that employers are putting safety before profit; further notes that some ferry companies have abandoned sick pay schemes, are making redundancies and want to permanently replace UK Ratings with non-UK crews paid below the National Minimum Wage; notes that these attacks on seafarers are taking place despite the UK taxpayer supporting 80 per cent of the wages of over 2,100 maritime workers, mainly seafarers and dockers furloughed by P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Line; agrees with the RMT that all taxpayer support given to employers during and after the pandemic should be linked to adequate safety protection and increased employment and training for UK Ratings and port workers in the long term; and also urges the Government to work with the RMT to set a new deal for the maritime industry which ends the UK&#8217;s reliance on low cost crewing on shipping routes from UK ports and to re-build maritime employment, infrastructure and skills, particularly in port towns and cities.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the life and work of Denis Goldberg, anti-apartheid campaigner, a hero of the South Africa liberation struggle, sentenced alongside Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia trial, imprisoned for 22 years, founder of the Community Heart Charity, frequent visitor to Scotland and the UK, Patron of the Nelson Mandela Scottish Memorial Foundation, and Patron of the Kronendal Music Academy who passed away on the 29 April 2020; sends condolences to his family at this sad time; admires the way he continued the anti-apartheid and liberation struggle while in prison, separated from Mandela and his other comrades on Robben Island and incarcerated in Pretoria Central prison as he was white; his continued tireless work for the future of all South Africa&#8217;s people thereafter; recognises his devotion to his last great project, the House of Hope in his community of Hout Bay, near Cape Town, which is to be a centre for the arts and community organisations as well as housing his own extensive collection of African Art; celebrates his life, and notes that he was respected, valued and admired by everyone who worked with him and who experienced the pride and passion he had for his work for a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic South Africa; and equality and justice throughout the world.</p>
			<hr class="Half-line-after">
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">451</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Future of the North Sea Oil and Gas Industry</h3>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House believes that the dual impact of low oil prices and covid-19 could lead to the collapse of the North Sea oil and gas industry; notes the Offshore Co-ordinating Group (OCG) of trade unions&#8217; estimate that 3,500 jobs in the supply chain are at immediate risk, with over 1,000 redundancy notices in the drilling sector alone; further notes the employers&#8217; estimate that 30,000 industry jobs could be lost by autumn 2021; notes that oil and gas meets over 75 per cent of the UK&#8217;s primary energy needs and that imports increase carbon emissions; welcomes the formation of the Pandemic Steering Group including employers, regulators and OCG unions; agrees with the view that furlough is a welcome but temporary measure; notes that oil and gas reserves under the North Sea are publicly owned; believes that the state should be the licensee for exploiting oil and gas resources under the UK Continental Shelf; further believes that a Just Transition to net zero carbon is impossible if domestic oil and gas reserves are shut down before 2050; and calls on the Government to prioritise the formation of a task force including OCG trade unions, employers and the Scottish Government to protect jobs and skills, production, investment, decommissioning and tax revenue from this strategically vital industry.</p>

			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">452</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Protecting bus workers during the covid-19 outbreak</h3>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span><span class="signatory">John Cryer</span></p>
			<p>That this House commends the UK's front-line bus workers, many of whom have continued to work during the covid-19 outbreak in order to provide transport for other key workers; regrets that tragically, across the UK, a number of bus workers have died from covid-19; is concerned by the findings of a recent survey of bus workers by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union which shows that over 20 per cent of bus workers had been issued no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by their employer, only half had a protective screen fitted in their driving cab and three quarters of bus workers have no access to washing facilities at work; further notes that unlike the rail sector, there is no national coronavirus forum to deal with those issues in the bus sector; recommends that emergency funding for bus operators should be dependent on the compulsory implementation of safety measures to provide all bus workers with sufficient PPE and testing for all those people who exhibit symptoms of covid-19, enforce social distancing measures on all buses, and allow cashless travel; and calls on the Government to work with the transport unions to ensure that all bus workers are protected.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Martyn Day</span><span class="signatory">Clive Lewis</span><span class="signatory">John Cryer</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the plans of the new Israeli coalition government to annex part of the occupied West Bank; further notes that Israeli legislation can progress from 1 July 2020 to carry out such an annexation; highlights that any such annexation of territory occupied in 1967 is a breach of international law which rejects any acquisition of territory through force and that it would be a major threat to peace; notes that when Russia illegally annexed the Crimea in 2014, the UK joined EU partners in imposing sanctions on that country; calls on the Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that such a step will have severe consequences for the UK-Israel relationship; and further calls on the Government to introduce sanctions similar to those impose on Russia in the event that an annexation of occupied territory takes place.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Kate Osborne</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; proposal to make 1,100 redundancies amongst key workers in Dover and Hull; further notes that this includes over 730 seafarer ratings who make up 8 per cent of the total UK workforce; offers support to the workers and families in coastal communities affected by this decision which is reminiscent of P&amp;O&#8217;s attacks on British seafarer jobs and trade unions in the 1980s; notes that P&amp;O has received an undisclosed figure from the taxpayer to keep freight routes from the UK running and over &#163;10 million public funding to pay 80 per cent of the wages of 1,400 furloughed staff members, some of whom now face redundancy; believes that any public funding received by shipping companies to address the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic should be conditional on the protection of UK seafarer jobs; further notes that P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; parent company DP World made &#163;1.3 billion profit last year and paid a &#163;270 million dividend to shareholders at the end of April 2020; believes that P&amp;O is seeking to permanently replace British crews with cheaper foreign crews using the low-cost crewing model, including on the fleet of new Ro-Ro passenger ferries on order from a Chinese shipyard for the Dover-Calais route; and calls on the Government to intervene immediately in order to save British seafarers&#8217; jobs at P&amp;O Ferries.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Stuart C McDonald</span><span class="signatory">Christine Jardine</span><span class="signatory">Andrew Gwynne</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the adverse effect the covid&#8211;19 pandemic has on social isolation generally and new mothers on maternity leave in particular; highlights the importance of social interaction and building bonds within extended family circles and wider society both for the babies development and mothers wellbeing; and acknowledges that this is impossible during lockdown restrictions, that a Parliamentary Petition calling for a three month extension to maternity leave has significantly passed the threshold for debate but given no petition debates are occurring at present calls on the Government to consider this proposal positively.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Nadia Whittome</span></p>
			<p>That this House is concerned about the high number of tenants who have lost income during the coronavirus crisis; further concerned about the number of tenants who are in rent arrears and are at risk of eviction as soon as the temporary freeze on evictions is lifted; notes that this crisis comes at a time when our housing system already prioritises the private profits of landlords over the rights of tenants; is concerned about reports of tenants being pressured into paying rent when that leaves them without enough money for food or other essentials; commends the work of tenant and community unions including ACORN, Living Rent and the London Renters Union in organising to protect communities during this crisis; calls on the Government to suspend rent immediately for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis, cancel rent arrears accrued during the crisis and protect renters from eviction so that no one loses their home while they are trying to cope with Coronavirus and its aftermath.</p>

			<p>That this House calls for a decent and fair pay rise for all workers delivering local authority services; notes that local authority and school staff are working above and beyond the call of duty with the daily risk presented by covid-19; respects workers&#8217; dedication to keep public services running and our country on track: pays tribute to frontline local authority workers who are protecting our communities in a wide range of vital services from caring for the young, vulnerable and elderly to collecting rubbish and from cleaning streets to working in crematoria to ensure dignity for those who have, sadly, fallen victim to this virus; is deeply concerned that those workers continue to be some of the lowest paid in the economy and that many have seen their pay drop in real terms by over 20 per cent after 10 years of austerity and cuts; acknowledges that the current pay offer to local authority staff is inadequate and that the misunderstanding of the annual leave section of the joint union claim is insulting to staff; is further concerned that the lowest paid are being asked to accept a pay rise of little more than &#163;1.82 per day; and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that local authority workers receive the dignity and fairness they deserve.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>
