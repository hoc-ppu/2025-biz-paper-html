			<p class="MotionSponsor">Fleur Anderson</p>
			<p>That this House is very concerned that 2.2 billion people around the world still don&#8217;t have a reliable source of clean water; believes that far too little is being done to help the most vulnerable people adapt to climate change; notes that access to a reliable source of clean water which can withstand the impacts of climate change can mean the difference between life and death, and that this makes access to basic water and sanitation services a first line of defence against climate change; recognises that failure to adapt now will cost significantly more in the long run and threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of people; and calls for the Government to recognise and prioritise water services in climate change plans at COP26.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jonathan Edwards</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates Carmarthenshire Council for becoming the first local authority in Wales to launch a strategy to become net-zero carbon neutral by 2030; notes that the highly-ambitious strategy of the County Council, approved by the full council at its meeting on 12 February 2020, sets out actions to cut carbon emissions and measures to offset the negative effects of C02; believes that this landmark strategy will greatly benefit local residents and global citizens; pays tribute to local environmental activists for engaging positively with the council on this issue; encourages local authorities across Wales to follow the example of Carmarthenshire on climate action; and urges both the UK and Welsh Governments to adopt more ambitious targets to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that people living in residential care homes represent some of the most vulnerable members of society most of whom have made commendable contributions to society over the course of their working and social lives; welcomes the Government&#8217;s ongoing review of social care policy; notes that there are still many instances of neglect across the care sector; and calls on the Government to include provisions in any legislative proposals to enable residents, should they so choose and at their own expense, to have CCTV in their room in order to provide greater protection, to provide family members with additional peace of mind, to raise standards and to provide higher levels of accountability.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John Nicolson</p>
			<p>That this House congratulates Calum Kettles, S1 pupil at Alva Academy, who has been selected to represent Scotland in an international fencing competition next month in Wroclaw, Poland; notes that Calum was awarded funding from the Rotary Club of Alloa to purchase fencing equipment, enabling him to take his place in the under-13 Scottish Fencing Team; further notes that Calum will represent his country for the first time following his success in competitions across Scotland, where he has consistently won bronze medals; and highlights the fact that Calum uses the skills and knowledge he has gained to assist and coach young fencers in Scotland and already instructs adult beginners who are almost twice his height and three times his age.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the international campaign Sack the Sachet by A Plastic Planet, which seeks to end the world&#8217;s reliance on single-use sachets that are so damaging to the environment; notes that globally 855 billion sachets are thrown away every year, enough to wrap the entire surface of the planet or, if placed end to end, stretch to the moon 189 times; further notes that the figure could reach one trillion by 2030; acknowledges that those sachets are almost exclusively made of plastic and are single-use items that will end up in landfill, in incinerators or directly in our natural environments; highlights that those sachets are  used for a range of purposes such as condiments, toiletries and washing powder, despite all of those items having reusable and more environmentally friendly alternatives; and calls on the Government as well as hon. Members to work together to end the scourge of the plastic sachet and help build a more sustainable planet.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Liz Saville Roberts</p>
			<p>That this House is concerned by the new draft media law in Somalia that would restrict the right to freedom of expression; notes that the Federal Parliament of Somalia sought to amend media legislation to grant the Federal Ministry of Information extensive powers to interfere in the work of journalists and independent media houses, and impact on public interest reporting in country; further notes that the law has a number of unacceptably broad restrictions on the content of what may be published or broadcast, including a prohibition on false news, encouragement of tribalism, baseless propaganda and violating sound Somali culture; believes that the draft law would also establish a costly and unnecessary new system of prosecutors to bring and hear cases regarding media crimes; is concerned that the draft law includes legal sanctions for a long new list of media crimes which are vague and breaches a journalist&#8217;s right to confidential sources; agrees with the National Union of Journalists and the National Union of Somali journalists that the draft law could enable the Somali authorities at both Federal and State level to arbitrarily prosecute journalists to undercut free expression and access to information; and calls on the Government to press President of Somalia Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed to think again about the draft legislation and to decline to sign the media law and to ensure that any proposed amendments are in line with Somalia&#8217;s constitutional and international obligations and commitments to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression.</p>

			<p>That this House deplores the rise in verbal and physical abuse of shopworkers, notes that according to research conducted by USDAW, over 400 retail workers were assaulted each day last year and that 62 per cent of retail staff have been the victim of either verbal or physical abuse; further notes that the view of respected criminologists is that levels of violence against shopworkers have reached epidemic proportions with lasting effects on the lives of workers, both mentally and physically; supports demands for action called for by the Freedom of Fear campaign led by USDAW, the similar demand for action call by the Co-op Group, the GMB and other Trade Unions, other leading retailers, the British Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience  Stores; and calls on the Government to introduce measures to tackle these issues including bringing forward legislative proposals to make assaulting a public facing worker a standalone offence which would provide not only a clear deterrent to those thinking of assaulting shopworkers but also clear routes to prosecution for the police and courts dealing with this growing problem.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Munira Wilson</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the significant impact of reading for pleasure in improving a child&#8217;s educational attainment and life chances; notes that children who read for pleasure daily or nearly every day are a year ahead in reading performance compared those who never do; notes with concern that child literacy rates are falling year on year; believes an improvement in literacy rates will help close the attainment gap; further notes that not all schools have libraries; recognises that 10 to 16 year olds make four time as much progress in vocabulary, maths and spelling if they read for pleasure than if their parents have a degree; further recognises that the UK has one of the lowest rankings for teenage literacy in OECD countries; highlights that reading to children, with no formal teaching agenda, is the most effective way to encourage them to read for pleasure independently; and calls on the Government to support teachers to include opportunities for non-tested story time as an intrinsic part of every school day</p>

			<p>That this House notes that racehorses are routinely beaten with a whip under rules set by the industry's regulatory body, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which sanctions this violent treatment in order that jockeys may, as it is claimed, encourage racehorses to improve their chances of winning, even though evidence indicates that whipping for this purpose is counter-productive; further notes that there were more than 400 breaches of the rules in 2019, mostly for whipping racehorses more than the permitted number of strikes; notes that no other animal can be legally beaten in such circumstances and that a 2018 YouGov poll found that, of those who expressed an opinion, 83 per cent of respondents oppose racehorses being whipped; recognises that, for genuine purposes of safety where other methods have failed to bring a horse under control, a whip can be legitimately employed, as is the case in Norway; and calls on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that the BHA's rules are amended to prohibit use of the whip for encouragement or for equivalent reasons.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that the Government has for over two decades failed women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of the changes that were made to their state pension age due to equalisation brought on by the Pensions Act 1995; regrets that the Government only began writing to women affected from 2009 onward; acknowledges that the Scottish National Party previously submitted a fully funded proposal to help women born in the 1950s that was rejected by the Government; believes the onus is now on the Government to remedy the injustices suffered by millions of women across the UK; and calls on the Government to oversee a full impact assessment, which takes into account the wide reaching effects of its policy, and to make a decision on the recompense that affected women will receive based on the findings of such an assessment.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that the EU Settlement Scheme does not deliver sufficient assurance of their future status to all EU nationals resident in the UK; notes that some EU nationals and non-EU family members will be unable to obtain their status for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness or understanding about the scheme, misconceptions about who needs to apply, difficulties evidencing residency or identity and confusion around deadlines; recognises that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals and non-EU family members, especially marginalised groups such as older and disabled people are at risk of falling out of status; further is concerned that EU nationals left without status will be denied the right to work, rent accommodation or access free healthcare will be criminalised for attempting to engage in any of these activities, and will become vulnerable to detention and removal; notes that no comparable application scheme anywhere has ever succeeded in reaching 100 per cent of its audience; believes it is vital to remove the cliff-edge scenario which will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing status overnight; and calls on the Government to deliver on its promise that EU nationals will be welcome to stay in the UK by bringing forward legislation to grant automatic settled status to all EU nationals and non-EU family members resident in the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the overturning by the High Court of Justice Tolson&#8217;s ruling in the Central Family Court that a sexual assault did not constitute rape because the woman had taken no physical step to encourage the man to desist; notes with concern the High Court&#8217;s findings that Justice Tolson failed to apply the definitions of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour, dismissed or ignored reports from the police, failed to allow the Appellant to make her full submission and repeatedly interrupted her; further notes with concern the High Court&#8217;s findings on Justice Tolson&#8217;s judgment that the real risk of the appearance of a partisan approach in that judge&#8217;s conduct was self-evident and that the fact that the judge preferred the Respondent&#8217;s case was patent throughout his judgment; highlights the High Court&#8217;s further findings that Justice Tolson&#8217;s reasons for dismissing the evidence of the Appellant were wrong, specifically, that he made a finding regarding the Appellant&#8217;s psychological state of mind without any forensic expert evidence; further highlights that the High Court found that Justice Tolson&#8217;s approach towards the issue of consent was manifestly at odds with current jurisprudence, concomitant sexual behaviour, and what is currently acceptable socio-sexual conduct; notes with concern that Justice Tolson continues to preside over cases involving domestic abuse and rape in the Family Courts; and calls on the Government to take steps with the Judicial College to ensure that training is made mandatory for family court and criminal court judges on the legally correct and appropriate approach to take when hearing domestic abuse and sexual assault allegations.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the poor mental health, including feelings of depression and anxiety, experienced by nearly half of people after a bereavement as revealed in Sue Ryder&#8217;s recent survey; notes that this is partly a result of a lack of conversation in society around grief with a third of bereaved people feeling unable to talk openly about their loss; recognises the reluctance of people to start a conversation with someone who is bereaved with over half being scared they would say the wrong thing and nearly half not knowing what to say; commends Sue Ryder for launching the #JustSaySomething campaign; encourages people who have been bereaved to open up to their support network and ask for help from their GP if they need it, those supporting someone struggling with their grief to encourage conversation and be ready to listen and for people supporting those who are grieving to find tips on how to do this on the Sue Ryder website; and further recognises the role of public figures in society in facilitating and encouraging everyone dealing with bereavement to talk freely when they want to and to create as compassionate a society as possible.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by the slow implementation of many areas of the Peace Accord in Colombia, including rural reform, crop substitution and victims&#8217; rights to justice which lie at the root of the conflict, as well as the often disproportionate use of force by officials in response to social protest; notes with alarm that areas vacated by the FARC have been filled by other illegal armed groups and militarised more generally, resulting in local populations being marginalised and threatened; urges the Colombian Government to comply with Resolution 1190/2018 of the Ministry of the Interior when addressing social protest, to seriously consider making the National Police accountable to civilian authorities rather than the Ministry of Defence, to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of on-going attacks and killings of social leaders and human rights defenders, and to implement all elements of the Peace Accord, as well as territorial development plans (PDETs); and calls on the Government to closely monitor spending by the Colombian Government of the UK&#8217;s funding for the implementation of the Peace Accord, to continue playing a key role on the UN Security Council on Colombia, including with the Verification Mission, whose mandate should be renewed for a further three years, and to continue supporting the Colombian Government and civil society in fully implementing the Peace Accord to achieve a sustainable peace.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned that care leavers risk facing eviction and homelessness on their 22nd birthday, due to the increasing gap between the local housing allowance and private sector rents; regrets that care leavers aged 22 have their local housing allowance reduced to the lowest shared accommodation rate (SAR); notes Centrepoint&#8217;s analysis of rental data which shows that a room in a shared house would only be affordable in one of 234 local authority areas for those in receipt of the SAR; is also deeply concerned that homeless young people under the age of 25 are trapped in supported accommodation because the SAR is not enough to cover the cost of rent; regrets that this causes bed-blocking of vital spaces for other homeless people; notes that to extend the exemption from the SAR on an annual basis, it would cost around &#163;6 million for care leavers and &#163;3.8 million for homeless under 25s; and therefore urges the Chancellor to provide this relatively small amount of funding in the upcoming Budget which will make a huge difference to the lives of vulnerable young people, many of whom have experienced unspeakable trauma and difficulty.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises precision Radiotherapy as a cost effective, life-saving cancer treatment; notes that 1 in 4 people will require access to radiotherapy and that the treatment is crucial in 4 out of every 10 cancer cures; welcomes the Government's commitment to improve early cancer detection but believes the current state of radiotherapy provision is not in a position to cope with increased demand; further notes the shortfalls in radiotherapy delivery highlighted by the APPG for Radiotherapy including an estimated 24,000 patients missing out completely on radiotherapy, excessive treatment travel times, outdated equipment, staff shortages, incoherent commissioning restricting access to treatment and perverse internal tariff system which creates financial disincentives in commissioning the most modern and effective radiotherapy treatment; believes addressing these shortfalls are the route to improving the UK's cancer survival rates which lag behind international comparators; and calls on the Heath and Social Care Select Committee to hold a full inquiry into the current state of radiotherapy services as a matter of priority, add to the weight of evidence, and produce recommendations for the Government in support of increasing access and investment to this life-saving cancer treatment and press for the UK to be a world class centre of excellence for precision advanced radiotherapy.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the continuing shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatment to alleviate severe symptoms of the menopause and is alarmed that many women have been affected by shortages for over a year; further notes that this is also affecting hormonal contraceptive supplies which could lead to a rise in unplanned pregnancies and abortions; believes that all women have a right to uninhibited access to HRT medication and products and that this access must not be held back by market forces; welcomes the Government's work with suppliers and stakeholders to reintroduce 70 per cent of HRT products back on the market by 2020 February; is disappointed that a number of HRT medications and contraceptives remain unavailable and may remain so until the end of the year if not longer; and calls upon the Government to address this issue as a matter of urgency and set up an expert working group to investigate the reasons for the continuing shortages.</p>

			<p>This House notes with concern proposed changes to overdraft fees for individuals and businesses due to be implemented in April 2020; further notes that this would lead to substantial increases in fees for both arranged and unarranged overdrafts; recognises the need to simplify overdraft fees and however notes with concern how financial providers have used directives by the Financial Conduct Authority to maximise profits; and calls on the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority to urgently review the new pricing structure of overdrafts by UK banks and intervene to ensure fairness for consumers and businesses before the new financial year.</p>
