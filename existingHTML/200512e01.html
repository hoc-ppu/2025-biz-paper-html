			<p class="MotionSponsor">Margaret Ferrier</p>
			<p>That this House notes that 15 May 2020 marks the second anniversary of the wave of arrests targeting Saudi women&#8217;s rights activists; is concerned that several, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Naseema al-Sadah, Samar Badawi, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya&#8217;a al-Zahrani, remain in detention and eight others remain on trial; is dismayed by the continued detention of peaceful human rights and political activists across the Middle East, often in overcrowded and unhygienic facilities with limited healthcare provision, particularly given the dangers currently posed by the covid-19 pandemic; urges governments in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Iran, Syria, Turkey and Egypt to ensure that all those imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of their human rights are released immediately and that the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are respected in all prisons; and calls on the Government to recommend the release of prisoners of conscience to relevant counterparts in Middle Eastern countries, and elsewhere, as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mark Tami</p>
			<p>That this house recognises the financial pressure that many households are under due to covid-19 and that many of these will be legally entitled to refunds from travel companies; notes that some companies are not providing these refunds in a timely manner or are making cash refunds difficult to access; further recognises the significant pressure that travel companies are under; and calls on the Government to work with the travel industry to ensure prompt refunds are available to customers, in the interest of both consumers and the industry.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Jim Shannon</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Paul Girvan</p>
			<p>That this House notes with sadness the death of rock 'n' roll legend, Little Richard; further notes the wonderful legacy he left behind by all of those who enjoyed his tremendous musical talents and songs, such as Tutti Frutti and Long Tall Sally; and passes on sincere sympathy to his family and those who knew and loved him and who were inspired by his musical genius.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Grahame Morris</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Ian Mearns</p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; proposal to make 1,100 redundancies amongst key workers in Dover and Hull; further notes that this includes over 730 seafarer ratings who make up 8 per cent of the total UK workforce; offers support to the workers and families in coastal communities affected by this decision which is reminiscent of P&amp;O&#8217;s attacks on British seafarer jobs and trade unions in the 1980s; notes that P&amp;O has received an undisclosed figure from the taxpayer to keep freight routes from the UK running and over &#163;10 million public funding to pay 80 per cent of the wages of 1,400 furloughed staff members, some of whom now face redundancy; believes that any public funding received by shipping companies to address the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic should be conditional on the protection of UK seafarer jobs; further notes that P&amp;O Ferries&#8217; parent company DP World made &#163;1.3 billion profit last year and paid a &#163;270 million dividend to shareholders at the end of April 2020; believes that P&amp;O is seeking to permanently replace British crews with cheaper foreign crews using the low-cost crewing model, including on the fleet of new Ro-Ro passenger ferries on order from a Chinese shipyard for the Dover-Calais route; and calls on the Government to intervene immediately in order to save British seafarers&#8217; jobs at P&amp;O Ferries.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	12/05/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sir Mike Penning</p>
			<p>That this House, fully supporting the sport of shooting and the private ownership of firearms within the law, notes the importance to public safety of monitoring the medical health of firearms certificate holders during the lifetime of their certificates; further notes that Government policy, as expressed in Home Office guidance on firearms licensing, asks general practitioners to place a marker on the medical notes of certificate holders so that a doctor treating the certificate holder will know that they own firearms and can make police aware if concerns arise; is therefore most concerned at the number of police constabularies which have instituted practices in breach of Home Office guidance by adopting medical verification of certificate applications without providing for markers to be placed on medical notes; considers this a failure to implement Government policy which falls short in protecting public safety; and calls on the Government to ensure that an effective and efficient system of medical involvement in firearms licensing through the placing of markers on certificate holders medical notes is implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Dr Lisa Cameron</p>
			<p>That this House recognises the achievements of the Lunar Gymnastics Club based in Lesmahagow; commends the achievements of the individual gymnasts at the Club, which include medals being won at the Scottish Tumble Championships, Middlesbrough Festival and Scottish Championships; acknowledges the remarkable achievement of gymnasts qualifying for the British Championships, particularly Eve Hamilton and Lara Gourlay who, aged 11, qualified for the British Championships and will represent Scotland; congratulates Lunar Gymnastics Club for the work that they do in the local community, such as performing at local festivals and offering free taster sessions for all ages; praises the Club for making a group donation to The Trussell Trust Food Bank; notes the importance of organisations such as Lunar Gymnastics Club in bringing young people together and building sporting excellence alongside team spirit; and wishes all the members of Lunar Gymnastics Club success in the future.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">John McDonnell</p>

			<p>That this House supports World Press Freedom Day and the #FreeThePress campaign; supports the principles that journalists should be able to undertake their vital work unfettered by governments, that journalists jailed for reporting the facts should be freed, and that attacks against journalists are properly investigated with the alleged perpetrators brought to justice; notes with considerable concern the increased pressures and risks facing independent journalists and journalism worldwide during the covid-19 pandemic; calls on the Government to encourage governments overseas to uphold media freedom by not adopting or immediately repealing, disproportionate or unnecessary measures, including legislative provisions on fake news, internet restrictions, and limitations on journalists&#8217; accreditation and access during the covid-19 pandemic; and further calls on the Government to provide an update on its activities in relation to its global media freedom campaign launched last year, and to condemn publicly and hold to account governments including China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, Egypt, Eritrea and Azerbaijan, that feature at the bottom of the latest Reporters Without Borders&#8217; annual world press freedom index.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned by the different treatment of Maternity Allowance and Statutory Maternity Pay by the Department of Work and Pensions in the calculation of Universal Credit awards, with Statutory Maternity Pay being treated as earned income and largely disregarded under the work allowance and 63 per cent taper, but Maternity Allowance being treated as unearned income and deducted from any Universal Credit award pound for pound; notes that this can leave women in receipt of Maternity Allowance up to &#163;5,000 worse off over 39 weeks of maternity leave, relative to women in similar circumstances in receipt of Statutory Maternity Pay; further notes that employed women can end up on Maternity Allowance, rather than Statutory Maternity Pay, for arbitrary reasons beyond their control, and that self-employed women can only apply for Maternity Allowance; notes that, in 2019, more than half of the some 60,000 women granted Maternity Allowance also applied for Universal Credit; believes that pregnant women and new parents, who are under extraordinary financial and other pressure as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic lockdown, should not be further disadvantaged by Government policies that fail to take proper account of their circumstances; and supports the Child Poverty Action Group, Maternity Action, the Women&#8217;s Budget Group, the Fawcett Society and the TUC in calling on the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to remedy this anomalous injustice by amending the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.</p>

			<p>British Airways having announced its intention of implementing 12,000 redundancies and is introducing inferior contracts for all employees; believes that it is immoral that British Airways is utilising public funds, designed to protect jobs, while simultaneously seeking mass redundancies in haste, given also that furloughed British Airways workers are unable to engage in consultation relating to these redundancies and that British Airways has access to &#163;3 billion cash reserve and IAG credit line equivalents of &#8364;10.7 billion; and demands that British Airways halts its opportunistic redundancy and restructuring and engages constructively with unions and Government to positively plan for a just and sustainable future based upon a tripartite approach to ensuring UK connectivity and the aviation industry is maintained for the benefit of all and not just one company.</p>

			<p>That this House commends the UK's front-line bus workers, many of whom have continued to work during the covid-19 outbreak in order to provide transport for other key workers; regrets that tragically, across the UK, a number of bus workers have died from covid-19; is concerned by the findings of a recent survey of bus workers by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union which shows that over 20 per cent of bus workers had been issued no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by their employer, only half had a protective screen fitted in their driving cab and three quarters of bus workers have no access to washing facilities at work; further notes that unlike the rail sector, there is no national coronavirus forum to deal with those issues in the bus sector; recommends that emergency funding for bus operators should be dependent on the compulsory implementation of safety measures to provide all bus workers with sufficient PPE and testing for all those people who exhibit symptoms of covid-19, enforce social distancing measures on all buses, and allow cashless travel; and calls on the Government to work with the transport unions to ensure that all bus workers are protected.</p>
