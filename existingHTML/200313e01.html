			<p class="MotionSponsor">Stephen Farry</p>
			<p>That this House urges the UK Government to immediately request an extension to the transition period and to suspend negotiations with the EU until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to 1 or 2 years; believes that public health professionals&#8217; advice for self-isolation will inevitably reduce the capacity of the Civil Service to negotiate a future agreement as well as its ability to replace European frameworks and agencies; recalls that the Prime Minister said in a statement on 12 March that there will be severe disruption across our country for many months; calls on the Government to minimise uncertainty for people and businesses during the outbreak; and further calls on the UK Government to work closely with other European governments in responding to the pandemic.</p>

			<p class="Tabled-Names"><span class="Roman">	Tabled:</span>	13/03/20	<span class="Roman">Signatories:</span>	1</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Robert Halfon</p>
			<p>That this House marks the 32nd anniversary of one of the worst incidents of mass murder by chemical weapons when the town of Halabja in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq was attacked by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s war planes on 16 March 1988; notes that the use of chemical weapons caused agonising death, often in minutes, of 5,000 men, women and children as well as injuring over 10,000 and in many cases inflicting life-long and debilitating illnesses; further notes that the attack on Halabja was accompanied by a wider campaign of genocide known as the Anfal in which about 180,000 Kurds were murdered and thousands of villages razed to the ground in an act of destruction with continuing harm to the agricultural bedrock of the Kurdistan Region; applauds the decision in February 2013 of the UK parliament to formally recognise the Anfal genocide and the decision of the UK government to mark Anfal each year; believes that remembrance is vital not only to mark the memories of those who were murdered, many of whom have yet to be unearthed from so far hidden mass graves, but also to challenge the mentality in parts of Iraq towards the equality of the Kurds; and expresses its full solidarity with the Kurds in Iraq as they seek to overcome their tragic history and forge pluralism and prosperity in a pan-Iraqi context while being key allies in the continuing fight against extremism and bigotry.</p>
			<h2 class="underline">Added Names</h2>
			<p>Below are EDMs tabled in the last two weeks to which names have been added. Only the first 6 names and any new names are included.</p>
			<h3 class="EDMTitle"><span class="Roman"><span class="UIN">240</span></span><span class="UIN"> 	</span>Effect of the bedroom tax on foster carers</h3>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jo Stevens</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes that 56,160 children were living with foster families in 2019; further notes that the under-occupancy penalty (the so-called bedroom tax) was introduced in April 2013 under the Welfare Reform Act 2012; condemns the bedroom tax policy; expresses concern about the bedroom tax&#8217;s effect on some of the most vulnerable people in our country; notes that foster children are not counted as part of the household for benefit purposes; notes that foster carers are allowed one additional room in their home as long as they have registered as a foster carer or fostered a child within the past 12 months, meaning that foster carers with more than one child will still face the bedroom tax; further expresses concern that data on how many foster carers are subject to the bedroom tax is not readily available to the Government; calls on the Government to collect and make publicly available data on the number of foster carers who are subject to the bedroom tax; further calls on the Government to do more to support our hard working foster parents; urges the Government to acknowledge and reflect on the cruelty at the heart of its bedroom tax policy; and calls on the Government to abolish the bedroom tax.</p>

			<p>That this House congratulates Staggs, also known as The Volunteer Arms, on being named Pub of the Year in the Lothians by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA); notes that CAMRA reward the industry for consistently selling real ale in good condition, on its excellent service, welcome, atmosphere, style, decor, value for money and community focus; understands that Staggs will compete for overall winner for Edinburgh and South East Scotland; having won Pub of the Year for the UK in 1998 and the Best in the Lothians award 25 times; and wishes Staggs every continued success in this competition and for 2020 and beyond.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Rosie Duffield</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Caroline Lucas</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Olivia Blake</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises the need to end sexual harassment and violence at work, which is a hidden epidemic that particularly affects women workers, as well as young and LGBTQ+ people; acknowledges with concern the joint TUC and Everyday Sexism Project study which found that one in two women in the UK have experienced sexual harassment at work and four out of five of these women do not report the abuse because of poor reporting systems or fear of repercussions; welcomes ILO Convention 190, which aims to end sexual harassment and violence in the world of work by comprehensively defining this type of abuse, including all workers irrespective of contract type, sector or work place, and setting minimum standards for preventing and addressing any breaches; recognises that the Government supported the adoption of this Convention at the ILO centennial meeting in June 2019, and that swift action to sign up to and champion this ground-breaking agreement could both assist workers in the UK and potentially encourage other countries to follow suit; and therefore urges the Government to ratify ILO Convention C190 as soon as possible.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mohammad Yasin</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Layla Moran</span></p>
			<p>That this House recognises that the BBC is a national treasure, a public service the UK can be proud of, with world class programmes and services, that the public pay for; notes that whatever criticism there may be of the BBC&#8217;s news output, editorial decisions, governance, transparency, accountability and independence from government, public service broadcasting is a principle worth defending in its own right; further notes and condemns the Government&#8217;s recent briefing against the BBC, its threatened decriminalisation of the TV licence fee and the disastrous effect that that would have on UK public service broadcasting; notes the importance of the BBC for foreign diplomacy, the international respect it garners, and the global brand it offers in the context of the UK leaving the EU; is concerned about the rise of fake news, big data manipulation of democracies and other worrying technological trends that make it critical the UK public has access to a publicly accountable BBC that provides services which aim to inform, educate and build resilience to such dangerous trends; believes that the BBC positively influences the UK's media ecology through its high standards and investment in local, quality content; and further recognises the We Own It campaign backed by The New Weather Institute that calls for the BBC to stay a publicly-owned and funded public service broadcaster, a genuine and open process to make sure that the BBC has fair, sustainable funding for the long-term, and a BBC that enshrines greater transparency, accountability and independence to better serve the public in the 21st century.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Jo Stevens</span></p>
			<p>That this House commemorates for International Women&#8217;s Day the Matchgirls who went on strike in 1888 at the Bryant and May factory in Bow in response to poor working conditions; notes that factory workers were expected to work 14 hour days for poor pay in an unsafe working environment due to the exposure of phosphorus which was used to make matches; commends their achievements of scrapping the factory&#8217;s fine system, setting up a grievance system, abolishing the deductions for working materials and the improvement of health and safety standards; further notes the continued need to advocate for high labour standards; and recognises the Matchgirls as pioneers of gender equality and fairness at work who through their strike action and formation of the Union of Women Match Makers left a lasting legacy on the trade union movement.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Chris Stephens</p>
			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mike Hill</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir George Howarth</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates Commonwealth Day and the shared goals and bonds between Commonwealth nations, but regrets that half a million UK pensioners living overseas in so-called frozen countries, of which over 90 per cent are Commonwealth nations, are suffering unfairly because the value of their pension is frozen and not up-rated annually in line with inflation, plunging thousands of UK pensioners including veterans and former public servants into poverty; and calls on the Government to uprate the pensions of all UK pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Sammy Wilson</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Deidre Brock</span></p>
			<p>That this House urges the Government to introduce legislation to ban the imports and sales of real fur products; notes that the UK has long banned the main methods of fur so-called production, namely leg-hold trapping and fur factory farming, due to their inherent cruelty; believes that, in view of these bans, it is hypocritical to continue to allow the import of real fur; further notes that the fur industry in the UK has significantly declined over the last 40 years, is now rejected by the majority of global fashion houses and UK high street retailers, and that fur sales are soon to be banned in California; acknowledges that there is a political and legal opportunity for a fur ban with the UK leaving the European Union; further acknowledges that there is widespread public support for a fur ban; and further believes that a fur ban is a natural extension of the existing import bans on cat and dog fur and commercial seal products, and that a comprehensive fur ban will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the promotion of animal welfare.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Sir George Howarth</span></p>
			<p>That this House celebrates International Women's Day which took place on Sunday March 8; recognises the importance of marking the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women; reaffirms its commitment to promoting gender equality; notes with sadness that the subjugation and persecution of women and girls remains a global phenomenon; laments the fact that many women in the world are persecuted for both their gender and their faith, such as Yazidi women in Iraq or Hindu and Christian girls forcibly converted and married in Pakistan; believes that the UK government can play an important role in addressing the specific vulnerabilities experienced by women from religious minority communities around the world; calls on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development to recognise these specific vulnerabilities; and urges the UK Government to include targeted programming and aid for women who face double vulnerabilities as members of minority faith communities, include religion as a factor of vulnerability in any assessment made in planning and programming and ensure that sensitivity relating to the international right to freedom of religion or belief is integrated into gender-related and anti-discrimination programmes.</p>

			<p>That this House honours and recognises the sacrifices that our veterans and their families make; notes the particular sacrifices that the partners of veterans make and the consequences for them of tragically losing a spouse or partner serving in the armed forces; notes the changes announced in 2014 which allowed war widows or widowers that lost their spouse or cohabiting partner in service in the armed forces before 6 April 2005, and had not remarried by 1 April 2015, to retain their war widow pension for life regardless of ongoing relationship status; notes however that this regrettably excluded war widows bereaved before 6 April 2005 that had already had to surrender their war widows pension upon remarrying or cohabiting; believes that this is unacceptable; notes that the only way this group of war widows could regain their pensions is by divorcing their current partners and remarrying them; agrees with the then Defence Secretary who said on 18 February 2019 that this was a burning injustice, Official Report, column 1187; and therefore supports the campaign of the War Widows Association to rectify this anomaly; and urges the Government to correct this injustice by providing equalisation and compensation for the small number of war widows unjustly affected.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the negative effect that the new points-based immigration system will have on&#160;care, particularly considering the 122,000 job vacancies in the social care sector identified by Skills for Care; recognises the invaluable contribution that migrants bring to the UK as carers, and that low paid work should not be equated with low skill level; emphasises the need for an evidence-based immigration policy; and calls on the Government to engage with the care sector to ensure that&#160;its concerns on the proposed points-based immigration system and its possible consequences are adequately addressed in full.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the announcement to allow employed parents of premature and sick babies to to claim up to 12 weeks Neonatal Leave and Pay; recognises the positive impact this will have for thousands of families every year; understands that over 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care every year leading to many parents using their maternity or paternity leave before getting them home; notes around 1 in 4 working men do not currently qualify for paternity leave; understands that this limits parental involvement in their baby's care despite this being essential for babies&#8217; to have the best developmental outcomes; notes having a baby in neonatal care has been shown to negatively affect parents&#8217; mental health with some studies reporting up to 40 per cent of mothers of preterm babies showing signs of post-natal depression compared to 10 per cent of mothers generally; further notes that neonatal care is expensive with parents reporting additional costs of over &#163;280 for every week their baby is in neonatal care at a time when their household income is reduced; and calls on the Government to introduce these welcome proposals swiftly with consideration for parents who do not currently qualify for parental leave rights due to being self-employed or a worker.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the importance of quality local journalism; commends those who dedicate their working lives to serving the public by reporting important, timely and accurate information that is in the public interest; notes the importance of media reporting and how it helps to maintain local transparency and accountability and supports the health of democracy at a local level; celebrates that, from reporting on floods or courts, to covering significant community events and issues, the work done by local journalists is essential in sustaining public life; and therefore resolves to support the National Union of Journalists' Local News Matters campaign, and further consider ways in which additional investment, resources and support for local journalism can be encouraged in order to protect the future viability and sustainability of local quality news.</p>

			<p>That this House acknowledges that over 2,000 EU citizens living in Midlothian have applied to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living and working in the UK; recognises the enormous contribution that EU citizens make to the cultural and economic fabric of the UK every day; further recognises Scotland&#8217;s particular reliance on EU citizens, with 26 per cent of small employers in Scotland having at least one EU citizen on the team compared to 21 per cent across the UK; notes with concern the risk that treating settlement in the UK as a privilege rather than a right could have on small businesses in Midlothian as a hub for small business; condemns the EU Settlement Scheme for treating settlement in the UK not as a right but a privilege; further condemns the Home Office for its lack of clarity in providing details of how many EU citizens have been granted settled status and pre-settled status; and recognises that the incompatibility between the Home Office&#8217;s approach to EU citizens and the needs of Scotland further underlines the need for Scotland to pursue an independent future with a more compassionate, open migration system.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that each year, thousands of animals including monkeys, mice, pigs and guinea pigs are experimented on using chemical, biological and other weapons, causing prolonged and extensive suffering; notes that while these experiments are not conducted to develop or test offensive weapons, suffering can continue for hours until the animal dies or is killed; further notes that examples of the symptoms of warfare experiments include bleeding genitals, writhing, substantial incapacitation, gasping, continuous tremor and visible production of saliva; highlights that the suffering is in addition to the standard deprivations of life in a laboratory that include restrictions on movement, inability to choose cage-mates and stress induced by human presence, light and sound; further notes that in 2018 at Porton Down, 1,941 animals were experimented upon for warfare experiments and that 30.2 per cent of those experiments  were classified as severe which resulted in the highest level of pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm; and calls on the Government to introduce a ban on the use of live animals for warfare experiments.</p>
