			<p class="MotionSponsor">Scott Benton</p>
			<p>That this House notes that Britain's B&amp;Bs, guest houses and family-run hotels constitute a vital part of the UK&#8217;s tourism offer and our welcome to the world; notes that this sector of 35,000 microbusinesses have combined annual sales of &#163;3.6 billion ; stresses the important role that B&amp;Bs play in rural and coastal areas, where they are often the only tourist accommodation and play a key function in supporting local livelihoods and local food producers; urges all hon. Members to visit local B&amp;Bs between 16 and 22 March 2020 during National B&amp;B week; and calls on the Government to promote Britain's brilliant B&amp;Bs, guest houses and family-run hotels as a central part of its UK tourism strategy, to win export earnings through the provision of those tourism services and to help improve economic equity throughout the UK's regions, coastal and rural areas.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Claire Hanna</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Fiona Bruce</span></p>
			<p>That this House is very concerned that 2.2 billion people around the world still don&#8217;t have a reliable source of clean water; believes that far too little is being done to help the most vulnerable people adapt to climate change; notes that access to a reliable source of clean water which can withstand the impacts of climate change can mean the difference between life and death, and that this makes access to basic water and sanitation services a first line of defence against climate change; recognises that failure to adapt now will cost significantly more in the long run and threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of people; and calls for the Government to recognise and prioritise water services in climate change plans at COP26.</p>

			<p>That this House supports the international campaign Sack the Sachet by A Plastic Planet, which seeks to end the world&#8217;s reliance on single-use sachets that are so damaging to the environment; notes that globally 855 billion sachets are thrown away every year, enough to wrap the entire surface of the planet or, if placed end to end, stretch to the moon 189 times; further notes that the figure could reach one trillion by 2030; acknowledges that those sachets are almost exclusively made of plastic and are single-use items that will end up in landfill, in incinerators or directly in our natural environments; highlights that those sachets are used for a range of purposes such as condiments, toiletries and washing powder, despite all of those items having reusable and more environmentally friendly alternatives; and calls on the Government as well as hon. Members to work together to end the scourge of the plastic sachet and help build a more sustainable planet.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the publication of the UN&#8217;s database of companies operating in Israeli settlements; acknowledges that all Israeli settlements are illegal and that the transfer of a civilian population to an occupied territory is a war crime under international law; notes that complicity in war crimes is a serious criminal offence; reaffirms the Government&#8217;s obligation to uphold international law, and the corporate responsibility of companies to respect human rights, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles; is alarmed that UK businesses are listed in the UN database, while also recognising that the database itself is not exhaustive of all companies supporting illegal settlement infrastructure; welcomes the report of Amnesty International highlighting that companies cannot do business in or with settlements without contributing to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; and calls on the Government to fulfil its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and under customary international humanitarian law, by banning UK trade with illegal settlements and making binding regulations for companies to uphold human rights standards.</p>

			<p>That this House highlights that it is unacceptable that in 2020 women and girls pay more than men for basic products, including toiletries, clothes, and haircuts; notes that products marketed at women are, in some cases, 34 per cent more expensive than those aimed at men; further notes that the unfair price gap will have a significant financial effect on a woman over the course of her life; regrets that women are subject to the additional injustice of the gender pay gap, which sees 8 out of 10 companies still paying more to their male employees; commends companies that have adjusted their pricing and decreased the price of some of their razors so that they are more aligned with the price of men&#8217;s razors and encourages other companies to follow suit; notes the Government&#8217;s failure to support the Gender-based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill 2017-19; and calls on the Government to end the discriminatory Pink Tax by supporting the forthcoming Private Members&#8217; Bill to be tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West.</p>

			<p>That this House calls on the Government to take urgent action to protect free access to cash for people across the UK, which the UK&#8217;s largest cashpoint network, Link, has warned will collapse within two years without immediate intervention; understands that since January 2018, one in five free to use cashpoints has closed, around 9,500 across the UK, and that consumers currently spend a staggering &#163;100 million a year just to withdraw their own money; acknowledges that this comes on the backdrop of the closure of thousands of bank branches and post offices, with these closures being particularly damaging to more rural communities, and there has been no replacement for these services; recognises that access to free cash is vitally important to some of our most vulnerable communities, many of whom are digitally excluded, such as pensioners and those on low incomes; appreciates that the loss of free cash machines is occurring at a much higher rate in more socially disadvantaged areas, forcing already poor communities to pay significant fees to access their cash, affecting their ability to pay for necessities; and calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to  ensure that the provision of free access to cash is protected so that no community is left behind in an increasingly digital society.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned by reports that changes by the Home Office to Tier 4 visa regulations have adversely impacted many teams in the Scottish Women&#8217;s Premier League and potentially those in other sports; notes the changes have resulted in non-EU international students already studying in the UK now being unable to play sports on a completely amateur basis if even one player in that competition is playing in a professional or semi-professional basis; feels that this is a very blunt measure entirely lacking in common sense which places unnecessary restrictions on women&#8217;s football at a time when every support should be in place to encourage the sport to grow; and calls on the Home Office to urgently review the regulations to ensure that no one on a Tier 4 visa be restricted should they want to play sport without any financial remuneration.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern that Six Nations organisers have refused to rule out the possibility of the tournament going behind a &#163;300 million pay per view paywall in 2022 following the start of a new broadcast rights period; believes that by ruling out joint bids by terrestrial broadcasters Six Nations officials are making it inevitable that the rights to broadcast the tournament will be secured by a pay-to-view subscription service; is concerned that this move risks losing an audience that has been built up and will stymie the ability of the sport to attract young players to the game; notes that the Six Nations tournament has a long tradition of being aired on free-to-view television in the UK and that any decision that would limit access would be a retrograde step; calls on the Six Nations organisers to reconsider their decision on allowing joint broadcaster bids; and further calls on the Government to ensure that the long-cherished Six Nations tournament is given full protection under Group A listed event status.</p>
