			<p>That this House recognises the major importance of the tourism sector to the UK economy and that tourism-related businesses lie at the heart of many local communities; notes that this sector has been disproportionally impacted by the covid-19 epidemic; is concerned by reports that in areas of the UK reliant on hospitality and tourism, up to 35 per cent of jobs are permanently at risk because of the pandemic, and that Visit Britain estimates that covid-19 will cost the tourism industry around &#163;15 billion in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK; further notes that a reduced rate of VAT for tourism has long been recommended by three select committees and attracted cross-party support; highlights that the UK is one of only three European countries to have never taken advantage of the EU rules allowing a reduced VAT rate on tourism and that Germany has now cut VAT to 7 per cent to help specific sectors of the economy; calls on the Government to reduce tourism VAT to 5 per cent to help this sector recover from the pandemic, at the same time as strengthening the wider economy, supporting job creation and generating investment in local businesses.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the decision of TSB and Bank of Scotland to close their branches in Kinross; further notes that Kinross has already lost a number of bank branches in recent years and that Kinross-shire is set to become the first county in Scotland to be left without a single bank branch; notes that surrounding towns and villages in Kinross-shire depend upon these branches for business and personal banking services; acknowledges that not everyone has access to online banking and can&#8217;t always travel the extra distance to alternative branches due to transport and mobility issues; further notes that the decision is at odds with increased demand due to Kinross's growing population; and urges the Government to work with banks to ensure that nobody in Kinross-shire is left to suffer from financial exclusion.</p>

			<p>That this House welcomes the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) but is concerned that the details do not reflect the reality of self-employment in the UK; notes that the scheme calculates support based on three years of tax returns and therefore financially penalises those who have worked part time or not at all during that period because of caring responsibilities or maternity/paternity leave, as well as new starters and the recently self-employed; further notes that those who combine PAYE work with being self-employed are not eligible for a proportionate amount of support from the SEISS as well as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme; notes that neither profit invested back into the development of self-employed businesses or paid as dividends to directors of small limited companies is counted as income for the purposes of the SEISS and that this is leaving many self-employed people without access to a liveable income; and therefore urges the Government to review the details of the SEISS to correct these anomalies and ensure that the scheme reflects the needs of the more than five million self-employed people in the UK.</p>

			<p>This House notes the increase in use of artificial intelligence and automated-decision-making to recruit, manage and pay workers remotely through the coronavirus pandemic; recognises that learning from past patterns of behaviour to inform decisions about the future increases the risk of deepening inequality for people and groups who are already experiencing disadvantage; further notes that fair access to, and terms of, work is critical at a time when 15 per cent of the workforce have already lost their jobs and over 2 million people are claiming universal credit; expresses concern that the auditing tools most commonly used to assess the risk of discrimination are importing legal standards from the United States which do not reflect the purpose or requirements of the Equality Act 2010; recognises new research from the Institute for the Future of Work which reveals significant limitations in exiting approaches to assessing the impacts of automated systems on equality; and calls on the Government to develop and enforce high industry standards to promote good governance and compliance of the Equality Act, to require regular Equality Impact Assessments as proposed by the Institute for the Future of Work and to review the application and enforcement of the Equality Act to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>
