			<p>That this House notes the acute difficulties facing business owners throughout the covid-19 outbreak, particularly self-employed people and directors of small limited companies; understands that the Government's financial packages have left behind people who have been left ineligible for any form of Government support; further notes that many self-employed directors of limited companies operated their businesses in this way following incentives from successive Governments by means of tax arrangements that made it easier to establish a limited company and expresses its deep regret that the Government has left these workers and business owners stranded and unable to access financial support through either the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme or the Self Employed Income Support Scheme; considers the availability of universal credit to be insufficient to allow individuals to both live and protect their businesses; and backs the calls from campaign group Excluded, which estimates that some 3 million workers have been excluded from Government support to date, to end disparities in Government covid-19 support packages that are currently excluding millions across the UK, putting livelihoods and businesses at risk.</p>

			<p class="MotionSponsor">Mr Gregory Campbell</p>
			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group"><span class="signatory">Wera Hobhouse</span></p>
			<p>That this House notes with concern the discrimination inherent in current UK abortion law that allows abortion up to birth for children diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot; that such disability-selective abortion up to birth is underreported according to the Department for Health and Social Care; recognises that cleft lip, cleft palate and clubfoot are treatable after birth and are not life-limiting disabilities and thus a primary diagnosis of any of the aforementioned should not qualify as a grounds for abortion under the Abortion Act 1967; that the many testimonies of individuals and celebrities born with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot demonstrate that these conditions do not hold people back in life; that allowing such individuals to be aborted up to birth is contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010; that UK abortion law does not reflect the positive change in societal attitudes towards disability in the anti-discriminatory, disability progressive culture of 2020; and recognises that UK abortion law must be changed to provide a person diagnosed with cleft lip, cleft palate or clubfoot with the same legal protections as any other person.</p>

			<p>That this House notes the need for Government action to support economic renewal as covid-19 restrictions are lifted; believes that this recovery must be a green recovery, designed to deliver the urgent objectives of restoring wildlife and the natural environment on land and at sea, averting dangerous climate change, minimising the UK&#8217;s global environmental footprint, and reversing inequality; considers that strong environmental laws are necessary for public health and a resilient economy, and to ensure more people benefit from the joys of nature that many have experienced or longed for in lockdown; further notes that green projects create more jobs, deliver higher short-term returns, and lead to increased long-term cost savings according to a recent Oxford study among others; believes that restoring the environment requires close collaboration with civil society organisations; calls on the Government to pursue an green economic recovery strategy that gives top priority to the health and wellbeing of people and nature; and further calls on the Government to avoid all measures that contribute to environmental harm and instead to invest in nature-friendly farming, large-scale green infrastructure projects including habitat restoration and creation, improved and equitable access to high-quality greenspace, a regenerative circular zero-waste economy that reduces resource use and addresses over-consumption, and a decisive shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy alongside nature-based solutions to climate change.</p>
