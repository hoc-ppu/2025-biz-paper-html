			<p>That this House notes the publication of Broken Faith, Britain&#8217;s Forgotten Heroes by the Campaign to End Frozen Pensions, which highlights the continuing injustice of the UK frozen pensions policy which affects over 500,000 UK state pensioners, including an estimated 100,000 military veterans, living in countries that do not have a reciprocal state pension uprating agreement with the UK, a policy which results in the affected pensioners having their UK state pension frozen at the level it was in the year that they start to claim it overseas, meaning that many of these pensioners are living on as little as &#163;40 a week due to being denied annual uprating as would happen if they had remained in the UK; and calls on the Government to end this injustice and to uprate the UK state pensions of all UK state pensioners in line with the triple lock, regardless of where they live.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned about the high number of tenants who have lost income during the coronavirus crisis; further concerned about the number of tenants who are in rent arrears and are at risk of eviction as soon as the temporary freeze on evictions is lifted; notes that this crisis comes at a time when our housing system already prioritises the private profits of landlords over the rights of tenants; is concerned about reports of tenants being pressured into paying rent when that leaves them without enough money for food or other essentials; commends the work of tenant and community unions including ACORN, Living Rent and the London Renters Union in organising to protect communities during this crisis; calls on the Government to suspend rent immediately for tenants affected by the coronavirus crisis, cancel rent arrears accrued during the crisis and protect renters from eviction so that no one loses their home while they are trying to cope with Coronavirus and its aftermath.</p>

			<p>That this House calls for a decent and fair pay rise for all workers delivering local authority services; notes that local authority and school staff are working above and beyond the call of duty with the daily risk presented by covid-19; respects workers&#8217; dedication to keep public services running and our country on track: pays tribute to frontline local authority workers who are protecting our communities in a wide range of vital services from caring for the young, vulnerable and elderly to collecting rubbish and from cleaning streets to working in crematoria to ensure dignity for those who have, sadly, fallen victim to this virus; is deeply concerned that those workers continue to be some of the lowest paid in the economy and that many have seen their pay drop in real terms by over 20 per cent after 10 years of austerity and cuts; acknowledges that the current pay offer to local authority staff is inadequate and that the misunderstanding of the annual leave section of the joint union claim is insulting to staff; is further concerned that the lowest paid are being asked to accept a pay rise of little more than &#163;1.82 per day; and urges the Government to take immediate action to ensure that local authority workers receive the dignity and fairness they deserve.</p>

			<p>That this House believes that any variations to lockdown restrictions must include a strategy to test, trace and isolate to prevent a new surge in coronavirus infections; notes that the Government plans to roll out a smartphone app to aid contact tracing; believes that for enough people to use the app for it to be effective, the public will need to have confidence that their personal data is safe, and that the app will work effectively; further believes that participation in the app must be voluntary; and calls on the Government to introduce legislation for a safe trace app to provide clear safeguards for personal data collected through the app and by human contract tracers, to prohibit discrimination against people who do not use the app, and to create significant penalties for the misuse of data.</p>

			<p>That this House condemns the continued practice of gay and transgender conversion therapies in the UK; notes that this practice has been linked to an increased risk of suicide, poor mental health and substance abuse; recognises that the Government has pledged to ban such practices in their LGBT Action Plan 2018 but has yet to bring forward those plans; further notes that many other jurisdictions have banned this abhorrent practice including most recently Germany; and calls on the Government to expedite plans to introduce a ban on conversion therapies in order to protect the UK's LGBT+ Community.</p>

			<p>That this House notes many students in further and higher education experience financial hardship during the course of their studies and that these difficulties are being exacerbated by the wider economic and social consequences of the coronavirus pandemic; further notes that financial support provided by awards agencies and student loan companies across different parts of the UK is usually provided on a term-time basis only, and that many students would seek to supplement their income with paid employment, especially during summer months; believes that many traditional summer job opportunities for students are unlikely to exist as a result of social distancing and economic restrictions; and urges all Governments across the UK  to work in partnership with each other, student representative bodies and relevant awards agencies and loans companies to ensure that adequate financial support is available to further and higher education students throughout the 2020 calendar year, including access to universal credit or other appropriate benefits, the provision of increased finance to further and higher education institutions to disburse through hardship funds, and access to other appropriate support during these unprecedented times.</p>

			<p>That this House notes with concern the UK Government&#8217;s stated position to stick rigidly to its timeline of ending the EU transition period in December 2020; recognises that this significantly increases the risk of a no-deal exit; further recognises that it will be impossible for the vast majority of businesses and communities to prepare for life outside the single market and customs union while coping with the effect of the covid-19 pandemic at the same time; notes that the devolved Governments did not give their consent to the Government&#8217;s EU Withdrawal Agreement legislation; concludes that the only realistic and reasonable approach is for the Government to revise its timeline for negotiation; further notes that Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement contains provisions for the UK-EU Joint Committee to adopt a single decision extending the transition for up to one or two years; calls on the Government to request a two-year extension to the transition period.</p>

			<p>That this House is concerned that covid-19 infections and deaths have disproportionately affected Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British people; notes that BAME people make up one third of covid-19 patients in intensive care, two thirds of NHS staff who have died, and out of twenty three NHS doctors who have died after contracting covid-19, twenty two are BAME; further notes that a British Medical Association survey revealed that 64 per cent of BAME doctors expressed concern about inadequate PPE, compared to 33 per cent of white doctors; believes that plans to lift the lockdown will potentially hit BAME communities harder because of their high level of representation in the NHS, transport and other public sector roles; supports the recommendation of the British Medical Association that the ethnic background of all covid-19 patients should be recorded; calls for a full independent public inquiry into the disproportionate effect of covid-19 on BAME communities; and urges the Government to ensure any such inquiry provides key findings and offers clear recommendations for systemic and transformational change in the role of the public sector and race equality.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises that the Government&#8217;s Everyone In policy has given approximately 5,400 rough sleepers temporary accommodation during the covid-19 pandemic; notes that this approach has allowed many homeless people to access services they previously did not, including healthcare; further recognises that covid-19 is an unprecedented threat that has left the most vulnerable in our communities at risk; is concerned by reports that suggest funding from the Government to local authorities to enact the scheme will end soon; calls on the Government to confirm that Everyone In will continue so that rough sleepers can be given the dignity of a room during this crisis; further calls on the Government to take adopt a housing first approach to provide rough sleepers with permanent accommodation as a priority; and further calls on the Government to make specialist support available to people that struggle with addiction or other mental health issues, as is the case for so many people sleeping rough across the UK.</p>

			<p>That this House is deeply concerned about the ongoing challenges faced by Merchant Navy seafarers who are unable to return home due to global covid-19 pandemic restrictions; understands that as a result of port and air route bans for individual travellers there are an estimated 2,000 UK mariners that have been unable to return home to their families, while relief crews cannot be brought in which has resulted in some seafarers being trapped on board their ships for over 120 days; recognises that this extended period of time stranded onboard with no apparent end date is having a significant effect on the physical and mental wellbeing of seafarers, as well as a detrimental impact on their families; acknowledges that merchant shipping handles around 95 per cent of the UK&#8217;s internationally traded goods and is essential to the UK&#8217;s economy; is concerned that seafarers are the UK&#8217;s forgotten key workers during this pandemic, delivering supplies and keeping our shelves stocked; urges the Government to sign up to the International Maritime Organisation&#8217;s new plan to ensure crew changeovers can resume; and calls on the Government to do all it can to prioritise the safe return of seafarers to their families and loved ones.</p>
