Business Papers CSS Classes to merge


Here are some ideas I've had for merging the CSS: 

Bold > _5-Bold
Master-and-Title-Page_OPDate > DateTitle 
DocumentTitle > VnP-Title
 
Could replace/simplify some of the ‘para’ CSS classes in OP HTML with some merging of the ItemTimingHeading, indent and Oblique classes used in VP HTML

Could use the CSS classes numbered InDesignBold and number in OP HTML
 
In general there seems to be a lot less CSS classes in the VP HTML - I remember thinking that the classes in the OP HTML could be simplified a bit if you would agree? That would make it a lot easier to have one CSS file
