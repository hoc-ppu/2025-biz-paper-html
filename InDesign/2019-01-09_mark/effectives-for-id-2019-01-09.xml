<MotionAmmendmentText>Line 1, leave out from &#8220;House&#8221; to end and insert &#8220;declines to approve the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal and would therefore lead to increased barriers to trade in goods and services, would not protect workers&#8217; rights and environmental standards, allows for the diminution of the United Kingdom&#8217;s internal and external security and is likely to lead to the implementation of a backstop provision in Northern Ireland that is neither politically nor economically sustainable; declines to approve the United Kingdom&#8217;s leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement; and therefore resolves to pursue every option that prevents the United Kingdom&#8217;s either leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement or leaving on the basis of the negotiated withdrawal agreement laid before the House.&#8221;</MotionAmmendmentText>

<MotionAmmendmentText>At end, add &#8220;notes that the Northern Ireland backstop is intended to be temporary; notes that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties makes it absolutely clear that a sovereign state can abrogate any part of a treaty with an international body in case of a fundamental change of circumstances since the Treaty was agreed; notes that making the Northern Ireland backstop permanent would constitute such a fundamental change of circumstances; and therefore calls for an assurance from the Government that, if it becomes clear by the end of 2021 that the European Union will not agree to remove the Northern Ireland backstop, the United Kingdom will treat the indefinite continuation of the backstop as a fundamental change of circumstances and will accordingly give notice on 1 January 2022 to terminate the Withdrawal Treaty so that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall become an independent country once again.&#8221;</MotionAmmendmentText>

<MotionAmmendmentSponsor>Amendment(h)</MotionAmmendmentSponsor>
<MotionAmmendmentSponsor>Daniel Kawczynski</MotionAmmendmentSponsor>
<MotionAmmendmentText>At end, add &#8220;and urges the Government to vigorously contest any breach of the spirit of the negotiated withdrawal agreement&#8217;s requirements of good faith and best endeavours by any Member State of the EU seeking to pursue its narrow national interest in relation to fishing rights or any other matters requiring the UK and the EU to reach agreement.&#8221;</MotionAmmendmentText>

<MotionAmmendmentText>Line 1, leave out from &#8220;House&#8221; to end and insert &#8220;declines to approve the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship in line with the views of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly that they would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole; notes the legal opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice that the United Kingdom has the right to unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded; therefore calls on the UK Government to request an extension to the period of negotiation under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union so that the UK does not leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement or on the basis of the negotiated agreement laid before the House on Monday 26 November 2018; and calls on the UK Government to respect the will of the Scottish Parliament in its vote on 5 December 2018 and the Welsh Assembly in its vote on 4 December 2018, which both rejected the withdrawal agreement as it now stands.&#8221;</MotionAmmendmentText>

<MotionAmmendmentText>At end, add &#8220;but no Minister of the Crown may move the Third Reading of any Bill to fulfil the ratification condition in section 13(1)(d) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 before the Attorney General has laid before both Houses of Parliament a statement of advice that sufficient assurance has been given in the European Council that no requirement in the negotiated withdrawal agreement to use best endeavours to conclude an agreement or any obligation to abide by an arbitration decision will prevent the United Kingdom from terminating the backstop arrangement once it is no longer needed as a necessary and proportionate step towards the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union.</MotionAmmendmentText>
