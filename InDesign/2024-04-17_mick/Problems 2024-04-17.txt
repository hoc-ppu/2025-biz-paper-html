There is a marked up proof OP20240417 in pdfs to check

Summary
Template needs adjusting to make text box full depth on page 1.
Contents page needs adjusting to align at the top of the text area.


Effectives

Questions sub head coming in as bulleted bold - manually changed to Heading3underlined

Not all of the questions came in.

Item 4 Manually changed the numbered paras.

CrossHeading para style needs font changing from 65 bold to Semibold

Motion Sponsor Group para style tabs need equalising - they are currenty at 60mm, 120mm so the first two columns are 60mm and the third is only 45mm. The 160mm tab needs to be moved to the page margin to stop bringing in short words like Ms and Dr

Announcements
Should they be grey headings or Heading3underlined?

HTML created on 10/07/24
Is not picking up anything after the contents. I have provided a picture of the warnings from Indesign - the warning about the contents always occurs but the text anchor doesn't. I think it's because the articles panel does not include the PrimaryFrame which normally happens automatically.

In Test of Articles panel I manually added the Primary Frame to the Articles Panel and it works ok. Or shall we just use "Based on page layout" for the html production.

Should PrimaryFrame be added to the Articles in the 01_SummaryAgenda-OP-Container template.
