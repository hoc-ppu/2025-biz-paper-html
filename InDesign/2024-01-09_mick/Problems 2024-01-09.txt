Questions

Sub heading is tagged as bulleted which is mapped to bulleted bold so I changed it to Heading3underlined.

Not all of the questions were downloaded comparing to the actual OP online - Missing 17 Kevin Foster . (900811),
18 Paul Blomfield  . (900812), 21 Alun Cairns (900815), 22 Julian Sturdy  (900816)

Business of the Day
Item 2
Not sure what the sub-items NHS dentistry and The cost of the Government's ... is supposed to look like. NumberedHeadingIndented has a bullet. This is how it downloaded.

Item 2 sub-item The cost of the Government's . . .
paras (a) to (e) and (i), (ii) manually changed to SubnumberedPara and SubSubParagraph

Amendment (a) Should this be NormalIndented2 as it's an amendment to an indented paragraph

Written Statements
Levelling Up, Housing and Communities not coming in correct alphabetically - always been a problem and noted also in a previous test file with Energy Security and Net Zero

Committee List
Treasury Committee withnesses NathanaÃ«l Benjamin should be Nathanaël Benjamin

Announcements
Not sure what is correct style. I think the grey headings should be Heading3Underlined not Heading2Grey. They are Heading3Underlined in the Order_paper_redesign.
