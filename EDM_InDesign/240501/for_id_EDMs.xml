<MotionText>That this House endorses the recognition from Dame Carol Black and the Home Affairs Committee that improved use of diversion schemes, where police deal with low-level offending without the involvement of courts, can be an important tool in reducing drug-related crime; pays tribute to the pioneering work of Police-led Drug Diversion (PDD) schemes such as Durham’s Checkpoint programme led by the late Ron Hogg, the West Midlands’ Operation Turning Point and the Thames Valley Druglink scheme championed by former Chief Inspector Jason Kew; highlights the importance of community resolution to preclude the need for arrest and to facilitate access to education, treatment and support services; welcomes the work of Professor Alex Stevens of the University of Kent and Paul Quinton from the College of Policing in providing evaluation of PDD schemes and identification of best practice; believes this will establish effective national standards and a template to end the patchy postcode-lottery of provision; and calls on the Government to commit to consistent national roll-out of high-standard diversion schemes, as soon as practicable, to provide a cost-effective alternative to the current cycle of criminalisation and reoffending.</MotionText>

<MotionText>That this House recognises the financial and emotional hardship experienced by vulnerable, elderly building society customers and their families through being introduced by building societies which they trusted to firms offering unregulated wills and trusts; acknowledges that the products sold were unsuitable and failed, with investments that did not match members’ attitude to risk, with excessive fees, and ultimately causing the loss of large portions of customers estates, and thereby the loss of their children’s inheritance; highlights the concern victims have that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has failed to act against the building societies despite many FCA Principles for Business being breached, and that the societies failed to perform satisfactory due diligence on the firms they introduced customers to; and as such believes that the FCA should compel the building societies to fully compensate, including for the upset, stress and hardship caused; calls upon the Government to ensure that, if the building societies make an offer of compensation, that the Creditors’ Committee can negotiate on behalf of the impacted individuals and if necessary give powers to the FCA to compel the building societies to compensate the victims in full; and further calls upon the Government to ensure that similar injustices do not happen in the future.</MotionText>
