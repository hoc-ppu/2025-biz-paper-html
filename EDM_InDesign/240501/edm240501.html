			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group">Liz Saville Roberts&#9;Ben Lake&#9;Hywel Williams</p>
			<p>That this House endorses the recognition from Dame Carol Black and the Home Affairs Committee that improved use of diversion schemes, where police deal with low-level offending without the involvement of courts, can be an important tool in reducing drug-related crime; pays tribute to the pioneering work of Police-led Drug Diversion (PDD) schemes such as Durham’s Checkpoint programme led by the late Ron Hogg, the West Midlands’ Operation Turning Point and the Thames Valley Druglink scheme championed by former Chief Inspector Jason Kew; highlights the importance of community resolution to preclude the need for arrest and to facilitate access to education, treatment and support services; welcomes the work of Professor Alex Stevens of the University of Kent and Paul Quinton from the College of Policing in providing evaluation of PDD schemes and identification of best practice; believes this will establish effective national standards and a template to end the patchy postcode-lottery of provision; and calls on the Government to commit to consistent national roll-out of high-standard diversion schemes, as soon as practicable, to provide a cost-effective alternative to the current cycle of criminalisation and reoffending.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group">Dr Philippa Whitford</p>
			<p>That this House marks the 10th anniversary of the UK Government recognising the Cornish as a national minority through the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; notes that this landmark decision set out numerous obligations including support for language and culture, education and the media, the greater visibility of national minorities in public life, the protection of historic territories, more opportunities on the international stage; further notes that the decision should afford the Cornish the same status as the UK’s other national minorities; is however concerned that the UK Government has yet to fully meets its obligations under the Framework Convention by treating Cornwall equally with the other national parts of the UK; and calls on the UK Government to deliver meaningful devolution through the creation of a legislative Cornish Parliament or a National Assembly of Cornwall, full membership of the British-Irish Council and other trans-national bodies, fair funding for Cornwall and its public services, a Cornish Language Act, and public service broadcasting provision for Cornwall.</p>

			<p>That this House recognises the new research from the End Child Poverty Coalition which highlights the extent to which the two-child limit impacts single parents and families with disabled children; notes that 20% of all households impacted by the two-child limit are families with at least one disabled child, which is just over 87,500 households; further notes that 25% of all families impacted by the two-child limit are single-parent households, with a child under 3; expresses incredulity that no assessment of the potential correlation between the proportion of children living in households affected by the two-child limit and levels of child poverty has been made by the Department for Work and Pensions; and calls for the two-child limit to be reconsidered.</p>

			<p class="Motion-Sponsor-Group">Sam Tarry</p>
			<p>That this House expresses support and solidarity to members of the PCS union taking industrial action against their employer, Border Force, at Heathrow Airport; notes that on 29 April around 250 staff are being forced out of their current jobs on passport control as the Home Office have indicated they will no longer accommodate their contractual flexible working arrangements, reasonable adjustments or ‘legacy’ contractual terms on a new fixed teams based roster; believes that the proposed new roster will not effectively deal with the issues which the Home Office claims it is intended to address and that, on the contrary, the inflexibility of the roster will see many staff come off the roster or leave the service; and therefore calls on the Home Office to address staff concerns and agree to shift from its current entrenched position so that further industrial action might be averted.</p>

			<p>That this House notes that on 24 April 2024 the Armenian community commemorated the Medz Yaghern (Great Crime) of the Armenian Genocide that saw the massacre and starvation of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottomans; further notes the significance of recognising the Armenian genocide and engaging in commemorative actions in paying tribute to the victims and supporting the Armenian community; pays tribute to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide, including many who share their testimony day in, day out, to ensure the horrors of the past are never forgotten; thanks all of those who work to educate every person from every background in the UK about the Armenian Genocide, its contemporary relevance, and why we must acknowledge this crime as having happened; urges all Rt hon. and hon.

			<p>That this House recognises the financial and emotional hardship experienced by vulnerable, elderly building society customers and their families through being introduced by building societies which they trusted to firms offering unregulated wills and trusts; acknowledges that the products sold were unsuitable and failed, with investments that did not match members’ attitude to risk, with excessive fees, and ultimately causing the loss of large portions of customers estates, and thereby the loss of their children’s inheritance; highlights the concern victims have that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has failed to act against the building societies despite many FCA Principles for Business being breached, and that the societies failed to perform satisfactory due diligence on the firms they introduced customers to; and as such believes that the FCA should compel the building societies to fully compensate, including for the upset, stress and hardship caused; calls upon the Government to ensure that, if the building societies make an offer of compensation, that the Creditors’ Committee can negotiate on behalf of the impacted individuals and if necessary give powers to the FCA to compel the building societies to compensate the victims in full; and further calls upon the Government to ensure that similar injustices do not happen in the future.</p>

			<p>This House recognises the impact that food price inflation has had on family budgets in recent years, with annual inflation of 19.1% to March 2023, which was the highest rate of food inflation in 45 years; notes with dismay that some retailers have taken to placing baby milk formula under security lock to avert the risk of shoplifting; considers that no parent should feel they have to resort to criminality in order to feed their baby; and therefore urges all supermarkets to urgently review the retail costs of baby formula and to cap it at no more than 1% of its production cost.</p>
