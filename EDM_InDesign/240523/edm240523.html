			<p>That this House notes with concern the rise of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries used to power e-bikes and e-scooters, which have quadrupled since 2020, resulting in 13 deaths, 200 serious injuries requiring hospital treatment and have resulted in homelessness and staggering financial loses; commends the important work of the charity Electrical Safety First, the London Fire Brigade and campaigner Alda Simoes in raising awareness of this issue; highlights that two coroners recently called for the law regarding the safety of these products to be tightened and therefore agrees with the support given to the Safety of Electric Powered Micromobility Vehicles and Lithium-ion Batteries Bill, drafted by the charity Electrical Safety First and experts from key sectors; further notes that this Bill has already gained the support of 44 national organisations including the London Fire Brigade and the National Fire Chiefs Council; and therefore calls on the Government to prioritise the time to implement the Bill&apos;s measures in order to ensure safer access to and use for sustainable transportation.</p>
